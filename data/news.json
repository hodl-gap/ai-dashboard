      "title": "Will Nigeria get its first AI data centre in 2026? The data says it is likely",
      "full_content": "<p>Nigeria’s push to position itself as a serious player in the global digital economy is increasingly converging on a single piece of infrastructure: data centres. As artificial intelligence workloads begin to reshape computing demand worldwide, the question is no longer whether Nigeria will build more data centres, but whether it is ready to host facilities capable of supporting AI at scale. Based on current projects, investment timelines, and technical constraints, the data suggests that Nigeria is closer than ever to commissioning its first true AI-focused data centre by 2026—but with important caveats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nigeria already hosts 17 operational data centres, with at least nine more either under construction or at advanced planning stages. One of the next additions is Equinix’s LG3 carrier-neutral facility on Victoria Island, Lagos, a 1-megawatt site scheduled for <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/11/11/equinix-data-centre/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">commissioning in the first quarter of 2026</a>. This rapid build-out places Nigeria among Africa’s fastest-growing data infrastructure markets, driven by rising demand from cloud service providers, financial institutions, telecom operators, and digital-native businesses. While installed capacity <a href=\"https://verraki.africa/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Opportunities-in-the-Rising-Data-Centre-Economy-in-Africa-04.12.25.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">currently stands between 65 and 86 megawatts</a>, industry projections suggest it could climb beyond 400 megawatts within the next three to five years as new facilities are completed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That build-out is anchored in a compelling investment story. Nigeria’s data centre market was valued at about $1.4 billion in 2025 and is projected to grow to $2.7 billion by 2035, representing an estimated compound annual growth rate of 7%, <a href=\"https://verraki.africa/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Opportunities-in-the-Rising-Data-Centre-Economy-in-Africa-04.12.25.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to a Verraki report published</a> in December 2025. Rising enterprise digitalisation, increased cloud adoption, the growth of fintech and e-commerce, and the emergence of AI-driven workloads are all fuelling demand. Consequently, local and international investors view Nigeria not only as a large domestic market but also as a strategic entry point into the wider West African digital economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why AI changes the equation</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional enterprise data centres are designed around relatively modest rack densities, <a href=\"https://www.datacenters.com/news/kw-per-rack-explained-optimize-your-data-center#:~:text=What%20is%20kW%20per%20Rack,:%2010%E2%80%9350%20kW/rack\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">typically between 10 and 15 kilowatts per rack</a>. AI workloads, particularly those involving large language models and GPU clusters, demand far more power, cooling, and network performance. At scale, AI-focused racks can require anywhere from <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/ai-power-expanding-data-center-capacity-to-meet-growing-demand\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">60 to 100 kilowatts per rack</a>, often relying on liquid cooling and highly resilient power infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Krish Ranganath, Regional Executive for West Africa at Africa Data Centres, a Cassava Technologies subsidiary with an operational 1.2MW capacity out of a 10 MW facility in project level and designed to scale up to 20.65 MW in Eko Atlantic City, Lagos, to meet growing AI and cloud demand, explains the difference clearly: “An AI data centre is fundamentally about high rack density.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While supporting technologies such as cooling, networking, and power redundancy can be engineered over time, density is the defining constraint. Under current conditions, Ranganath notes that a 25-kilowatt rack can support entry-level AI workloads if the facility is designed to scale. However, truly AI-native deployments require expandability and long-term power certainty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge is that data centres, whether conventional or high-density, take time to build. Typical construction timelines range from 16 to 20 months, even before accounting for power connections, imported equipment, and commissioning. While prefabricated solutions can shorten deployment cycles, they are difficult to deploy at hyperscale and often come with technical limitations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Economic impact strengthens the case</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond digital capability, the economic impact of data centres strengthens the argument for accelerated investment. Modelling by Verraki shows that a $10 million, 1-megawatt Tier III data centre generates approximately $17 million in economic output during the construction phase alone. When operational expenditure and refresh capital expenditure are included, cumulative economic output exceeds $39 million over ten years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employment effects are equally significant. A single 1-megawatt facility supports roughly 700 construction jobs and 20 to 30 operational roles annually, resulting in more than 1,600 cumulative jobs over a decade. These roles span engineering, power management, cooling, cybersecurity, and facilities operations, aligning closely with Nigeria’s push for skilled technical employment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At an industry level, costs remain high. Modern Tier III data centres typically require between $10 million and $15 million per megawatt to build. <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/04/01/why-data-centre-investors-are-flocking-to-lagos-coastline/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Open Access Data Centres’ 24-megawatt Lagos facility</a>, for instance, carries a <a href=\"https://developingtelecoms.com/telecom-technology/data-centres-networks/18230-oadc-to-invest-us-240m-to-expand-lagos-data-centre-to-24mw-by-2027.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported cost of $240 million</a>. Yet the multiplier effects—job creation, tax revenue, and demand for energy and ICT services—continue to attract capital.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Big players are already committing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Global and regional operators are no longer treating Nigeria as a speculative market. Open Access Data Centres announced a $500 million investment across Africa in 2021 and has since established operational facilities in Lagos and South Africa. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-23/us-data-center-operator-equinix-plans-390-million-africa-build\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">In 2024, Equinix committed $390 million to the continent over five years</a>. <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/07/01/mtn-nigeria-completes-first-phase-of-235-million-data-centre/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MTN Nigeria is building a 1,500-rack Tier IV facility</a>, while Airtel Africa’s Nxtra project in Nigeria is expected <a href=\"https://airtel.africa/airtel-africa-launches-nxtra-airtel-accelerate-africas-digital-transformation#:~:text=Airtel%20Africa%20launches%20Nxtra%20by,Africa's%20digital%20transformation%20%7C%20Airtel%20Africa\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to go live by the first quarter of 2026</a> as part of a broader hyperscale strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Airtel’s Lagos facility is notable because it is being designed specifically for AI compute rather than traditional cloud storage. The project represents a $120 million investment, with early shipments of high-performance GPUs already delivered in late 2025. This marks a shift from “AI-ready” marketing toward explicit AI workload support.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Kasi Cloud and the strongest AI signal yet</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The strongest signal that Nigeria could host its first true AI data centre by 2026 is <a href=\"https://www.thisdaylive.com/2025/12/11/agogbua-we-will-deliver-world-class-data-centre-facilities/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kasi Cloud’s flagship campus in Lekki</a>, Lagos. As of January 2026, the LOS1 facility is in its final stages of completion, <a href=\"https://www.kasicloud.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">with some parts of the facility already in use</a>, and is widely regarded as one of the most ambitious hyperscale developments on the continent. Backed by a $250 million investment and supported by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority, the project was conceived to handle the extreme power densities and cooling demands associated with AI and advanced cloud workloads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Built on a 4.2-hectare site with roughly 172,000 square feet of white space, the campus is designed to scale significantly. At full build-out, it can host between 3,000 and 4,000 racks across multiple data halls. Power infrastructure is a defining feature: the site is anchored by the largest dedicated data centre substation in Africa, with a total capacity of up to 100 megawatts. The first phase is designed to deliver between 32 and 44.4 megawatts of critical IT load, supporting rack densities that range from conventional 8 kilowatts to peaks of 100 kilowatts per rack, a threshold typically associated with liquid-cooled AI systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Location and resilience further strengthen the case. The campus is situated along the Lekki corridor, adjacent to several submarine cable landing stations, providing low-latency connectivity to global networks. It is engineered to Tier IV reliability standards and is targeting up to 95% renewable and carbon-free energy usage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Alex Tsado, co-founder and COO of Ahura AI and a founding member of the Alliance for Africa’s Intelligence (Alliance4AI), the facility has already opened its doors. He said Kasi Cloud is optimised for AI GPUs and is working in partnership with UduTech, a GPU cloud platform that accelerates AI innovation across Africa, founded by Tsado, to provide GPU cloud services tailored to regional AI demand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“UduTech plans to partner with them and MSI to link the GPUs to its cloud platform,” Tsado told TechCabal. “When the GPUs aren’t being used for gaming, others can rent them to run AI workloads at low cost, generating revenue for the GPU owners as well. Essentially, it’s a model where distributed GPUs earn money for everyone involved.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>GPUs, power, and the remaining constraints</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While infrastructure readiness is improving, constraints remain. Almost all specialised equipment, from GPUs to cooling systems, is imported, exposing projects to currency volatility and supply chain delays, according to Ranganath. High-quality, reliable power remains the single most critical factor, alongside dense network connectivity capable of handling large data flows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also transitional models emerging. <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/11/04/rack-centre-goes-hybrid-with-gas-and-solar/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rack Centre’s 12-megawatt LGS2 facility</a>, launched in 2025, <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/11/04/rack-centre-goes-hybrid-with-gas-and-solar/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">is marketed as AI-ready</a>, while partnerships such as NVIDIA and Cassava Technologies’ $700 million pan-African initiative aim <a href=\"https://www.cassavatechnologies.com/cassava-to-upgrade-its-data-centres-with-nvidia-supercomputers-to-drive-africas-ai-future/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to deploy thousands of GPUs</a> across Africa Data Centres facilities, including in Nigeria. These deployments are designed to close the computing gap for startups that previously depended on expensive foreign cloud credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are probably other AI-ready data centres or GPU system operators that I’m not aware of, but I believe Rack Centre is AI-ready,&#8221; Tsado said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evidence suggests that Nigeria is unlikely to flip a switch overnight into full hyperscale AI dominance. However, at least one AI-focused facility is likely to go live by late 2026, particularly as projects like Kasi Cloud and Airtel Nxtra move from construction to commissioning. As Ranganath cautions, many projects remain in redesign stages, and timelines are sensitive to power availability and execution risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

It is a signal of how quickly power is concentrating in the AI economy and how expectations are being reset in real time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to reports, the Claude developer is targeting a $350 billion valuation. If completed, the round would nearly double Anthropic’s value from its $183 billion Series F just three months ago, when it raised $13 billion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past year, Anthropic has raised capital at an unprecedented pace. In March, it secured <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/anthropic-raises-3-5b-at-61-5b-valuation-can-it-outspace-openai-in-the-ai-race/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$3.5 billion at a $61.5 billion valuation</a>. Just three months ago, the company raised a further <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/anthropic-raises-13b-series-f/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$13 billion in a Series F round</a>, valuing it at $183 billion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Separately, Anthropic also entered into a strategic $15 billion commitment linked to long-term compute purchases, tied to infrastructure rather than direct equity financing. If the recent speculation comes true, the valuation will nearly double in a year’s time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"valuation-as-a-competitive-weapon\"><strong>Valuation as a competitive weapon</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At this stage, valuation is a strategic tool. For enterprise customers, developers, and future hires, scale itself becomes reassurance. For rivals, it raises the cost of keeping pace. This round, reportedly led by <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/coatue-to-raise-1b-for-ai-startups-is-the-future-of-humanoid-robots-closer-than-we-think/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Coatue Management</a> and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC, reinforces the idea that global investors want exposure to AI leaders before public listings reshape the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deal is expected to close in the coming weeks, though sources caution that the final size could still change. Even so, the direction is clear and it is to have fewer AI companies are commanding dramatically larger pools of capital.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"drawing-a-line-between-capital-and-compute\"><strong>Drawing a line between capital and compute</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What stands out is what this round is not. It is separate from the $15 billion recently committed by Nvidia and Microsoft. That investment underpins a circular arrangement in which Anthropic would buy up to $30 billion in compute from Microsoft Azure running on Nvidia chips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By raising fresh equity outside that structure, Anthropic avoids being seen purely as a throughput machine for infrastructure partners. The new capital can support hiring, research depth, and go-to-market expansion, areas that matter just as much as raw compute in the next phase of competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"public-market-clock\"><strong>Public market clock</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The fundraising push also coincides with growing developer traction. Claude Code, powered by Claude Opus 4.5, has helped Anthropic deepen its presence in software workflows, turning its models into everyday tools rather than abstract capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this unfolds as Anthropic prepares for a potential IPO this year, alongside its closest rival OpenAI, which is reportedly exploring a raise of up to $100 billion at valuations reaching $830 billion. Together, these moves suggest the AI market is approaching an inflection point, where dominance is established privately, and public markets are invited in only after the hierarchy is set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

The parties have agreed in principle to settle; now comes the harder work of finalizing the details. These are among the first settlements in lawsuits accusing AI companies of harming users, a legal frontier that must have OpenAI and Meta watching nervously from the wings as they defend themselves against similar lawsuits. Character.AI founded in 2021 by ex-Google engineers who returned to their former employer in 2024 in a $2.7 billion deal, invites users to chat with AI personas. The most haunting case involves Sewell Setzer III, who at age 14 conducted sexualized conversations with a &#8220;Daenerys Targaryen&#8221; bot before killing himself. His mother, Megan Garcia, has told the Senate that companies must be &#8220;legally accountable when they knowingly design harmful AI technologies that kill kids.&#8221; Another lawsuit describes a 17-year-old whose chatbot encouraged self-harm and suggested that murdering his parents was reasonable for limiting screen time . Character.AI banned minors last October, it told TechCrunch . The settlements will likely include monetary damages, though no liability was admitted in court filings made available Wednesday. Character.AI declined to comment, redirecting TechCrunch instead to the filings. Google has not responded to a request for comment.

The company will use the funding to expand its satellite constellation, scale in-orbit AI computing capabilities, and advance research on high-power compute satellites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Founder and CEO Ronak Kumar Samantray said in a statement, “2026 has started with the [scheduled] launch of MOI-1, our first major orbital satellite powering OrbitLab. I am excited for the next phase of TM2S, where we will grow from a single satellite-based solution to a networked satellite-based solution.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MOI-1 is a 14 kg satellite scheduled for launch on January 12 this year, aboard ISRO’s PSLV C-62 mission. This satellite features the <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/hyderabads-mira-space-telescope-clears-nasa-grade-tests-set-for-launch-in-december/\">MIRA space telescope</a> and aims to serve as a functional ‘AI lab in space’ for approximately 15 customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that team expansion will be a priority in the coming months, from 17 employees to around 50–60 across engineering and sales roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samantray also told <strong>AIM</strong> that the upcoming MOI-2 satellite would replicate MOI-1, increasing the company’s total in-orbit compute capacity to 200 watts. He added that the forthcoming AaduSat mission would demonstrate propulsion systems for orbit maintenance and validate optical satellite links. The satellite will also test silicon-based solar cells in orbit, rather than traditional 3J-GaAs cells typically used in space for concentrated solar power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 2024, TakeMe2Space is building high-compute satellites and an orbital platform that would allow customers to run AI models directly in space. As Samantray expressed in a <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com/deep-tech/this-hyderabad-startup-is-building-indias-first-ai-lab-in-orbit/\">previous interview</a>, “Our goal is to ensure that everybody’s ideas can be taken to space. You don’t have to be at NASA, ISRO, or an IIT to run an experiment in space. Sitting in Kerala, Delhi, or even Antarctica, you should be able to operate a satellite.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company plans to deploy six satellites to support its OrbitLab platform, which offers near-real-time AI inferencing for Earth observation users. These will have around 5 kilowatts of in-orbit compute capacity and will use optical links to communicate with each other, a step the company says is key to its long-term data centre vision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The capital will help deepen the startup’s <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-startups/why-indias-best-space-engineers-are-choosing-to-stay-back/\">presence in India</a>, the United States, and Australia. It will also strengthen ties with ground station and assembly partners, and scale customer support to accelerate adoption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ranjith Menon, managing director at Chiratae Ventures, said the firm sees strong potential in the company’s approach. “TakeMe2Space is rethinking access to orbit by turning satellites into shared infrastructure,” he said, adding that the team’s execution ability drove the investment decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The startup has tested its MOI-TD (My Orbital Infrastructure &#8211; Technology Demonstrator) previously aboard <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/isro-creates-history-india-becomes-4th-country-to-achieve-space-docking/\">ISRO’s SpaDeX mission</a> in December 2024. It successfully demonstrated the ability to upload large AI models to a satellite, run external code and downlink encrypted results.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company has also validated its radiation shielding technology in orbit, which it says extends satellite life while using standard electronic components.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/takeme2space-lands-5-mn-funding-to-build-indias-data-centre-in-space/\">TakeMe2Space Lands $5 Mn Funding to Build India’s Data Centre in Space</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com\">Analytics India Magazine</a>.</p>",

The Ikoyi Metro EDGE facility is the first regional node in Fringe’s broader Metro EDGE platform, designed to bring high-performance compute and data services closer to users in dense urban centers. Unlike traditional large-scale data centers located far from city cores, edge facilities prioritize proximity, enabling faster data processing and improved reliability for digital services. Powering Nigeria’s Next Phase of Digital Growth Nigeria’s technology ecosystem — spanning fintech, e-commerce, cloud services, artificial intelligence, and digital media — has grown faster than the infrastructure supporting it. By hosting compute capacity closer to businesses and consumers, the Ikoyi Metro EDGE facility aims to reduce latency, improve uptime, and strengthen digital resilience in Africa’s largest economy. Industry analysts note that edge data centers are increasingly critical as applications become more data-intensive and time-sensitive. Services such as real-time payments, AI-driven platforms, video streaming, and enterprise cloud workloads all depend on fast and reliable access to computing resources — a gap Metro EDGE facilities are designed to fill. Strategic Location in Lagos Sited in Ikoyi, the heart of Lagos’ financial and technology corridor, the new facility places critical infrastructure close to banks, startups, multinational firms, and government institutions. This proximity supports faster connectivity and helps organizations meet data sovereignty and compliance requirements by keeping sensitive data hosted locally. According to Fringe, the Ikoyi Metro EDGE launch reflects a broader shift in how digital infrastructure is deployed across Africa — moving from centralized models to distributed, city-based nodes that better match urban demand. Building a Pan-African EDGE Network The Ikoyi launch is positioned as the starting point for a wider rollout of Metro EDGE facilities across major African cities. Fringe has signaled plans to expand the platform to support regional cloud providers, global technology firms, and local enterprises seeking scalable, carrier-neutral infrastructure. As governments and businesses across the continent accelerate digital transformation, investments in edge infrastructure are expected to play a key role in enabling smart cities, AI adoption, and next-generation digital services. A Signal of Confidence in Nigeria Beyond its technical impact, the Ikoyi Metro EDGE launch sends a strong signal of confidence in Nigeria’s long-term digital potential. With a young, tech-savvy population and one of the world’s fastest-growing digital markets, Nigeria is increasingly seen as a cornerstone of Africa’s digital future. The addition of modern, locally hosted infrastructure strengthens that position — helping ensure that innovation, data, and value creation remain closer to home.

ERP, 카드사, 은행 등 서로 다른 포맷의 데이터를 대조해 전표를 생성하고 보고서를 만드는 과정을 자동화함으로써, 재무팀 본연의 임무인 이상 거래 분석과 전략적 의사결정 지원에 집중할 수 있게 됐다.이런 실무 밀착형 기능에 힘입어, 그리디는 출시하자마자 뚜렷한 성과를 내고 있다. 지난 12월 진행된 실무 교육 세션에는 약 240명의 신청자가 몰렸으며, 전체 가입자 중 유료 구독으로 전환한 비율이 약 10%에 달한다. 단순한 체험을 넘어 실무 현장에서 필수 도구로 인정받고 있다.현재 그리디는 국내외 대형 경비 지출 관리 SaaS 기업들과는 전략적 파트너십을, 재무 아웃소싱 및 회계 서비스를 제공하는 업체들과는 B2B 도입을 중심으로 협의를 진행 중이다. 그리디는 정식 출시 기념으로 기존 유료 구독자 포함 신규 가입자에게 그리디 프로그램에서 사용할 수 있는 크레딧을 2배 제공하는 이벤트를 진행 중이다.정민규 커널스페이스 대표는 “커널스페이스는 실무자 개인의 AI 경쟁력을 높이는 제품을 만드는 것을 목표로 하고 있다”며 “그리디는 실무자들이 단순 반복 업무에서 벗어나 더 중요한 판단에 집중함으로써 자신의 생산성과 AI 시대에 시장 가치를 함께 높일 수 있도록 돕는 도구가 될 것”이라고 밝혔다.",

      "full_content": "[지디넷코리아]<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://image.zdnet.co.kr/2026/01/08/fa4c9f4f49537ebd64f8bca45b83c30e.png\" /><p><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0.8px;\">커널스페이스(</span><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0.8px;\">대표 정민규)가 회계, 재무 실무자들의 스프레드시트 업무효율화를 위해 개발한 엑셀 AI ‘그리디’를 정식 출시했다고 8일 밝혔다.</span></p>\n<p>커널스페이스는 네이버와 채널코퍼레이션에서 AI팀장을 역임한 정민규 대표와, 삼정KPMG와 채널코퍼레이션 재무부문장 출신 16년차 회계사 박상정 CBO(최고비즈니스책임자)가 채널코퍼레이션과 쿠팡 출신 전문가들과 2025년에 설립한 AI 스타트업이다.</p>\n<p>그리디는 복잡한 수식 입력, 반복적인 데이터 클렌징, PDF 데이터 변환 등 기존에 수작업으로 진행하던 엑셀 업무를 생성형 AI와의 대화로 해결해 주는 서비스다. 기존 ERP나 경비 관리 솔루션이 데이터의 ‘저장’에 집중했다면, 그리디는 저장된 데이터를 실제 마감과 보고에 쓸 수 있도록 ‘가공’에 집중함으로써 80% 가까운 실무 업무 효율화를 이룰 수 있다.</p>\n<img alt=\"gridie\" src=\"https://image.zdnet.co.kr/2026/01/08/fa4c9f4f49537ebd64f8bca45b83c30e.png\" />\n<p>그리디의 가장 큰 차별점은 ‘휘발되지 않는 워크플로우’다. 사용자가 평소 일하던 방식대로 AI와 대화를 나누면, 그리디가 이를 이해하고 자동화 코드를 즉석에서 생성한다. 이 과정은 최근 개발자들 사이에서 주목받는 ‘바이브코딩’과 유사하지만, 코드를 작성하는 대신 엑셀 업무를 자연어로 설계한다는 점에서 차이가 있다. 사용자는 이 과정을 ‘워크플로우’로 저장해 뒀다가, 나중에 파일만 바꿔서 클릭 한 번으로 동일한 작업을 반복할 수 있다. 마치 나만의 전담 개발자가 옆에서 업무 자산을 쌓아주는 것과 같은 효과를 낸다.</p>\n<p>기업 재무팀 또한 그리디의 효과를 톡톡히 보고 있다. ERP, 카드사, 은행 등 서로 다른 포맷의 데이터를 대조해 전표를 생성하고 보고서를 만드는 과정을 자동화함으로써, 재무팀 본연의 임무인 이상 거래 분석과 전략적 의사결정 지원에 집중할 수 있게 됐다.</p>\n<p>이런 실무 밀착형 기능에 힘입어, 그리디는 출시하자마자 뚜렷한 성과를 내고 있다. 지난 12월 진행된 실무 교육 세션에는 약 240명의 신청자가 몰렸으며, 전체 가입자 중 유료 구독으로 전환한 비율이 약 10%에 달한다. 단순한 체험을 넘어 실무 현장에서 필수 도구로 인정받고 있다.</p>\n<p>현재 그리디는 국내외 대형 경비 지출 관리 SaaS 기업들과는 전략적 파트너십을, 재무 아웃소싱 및 회계 서비스를 제공하는 업체들과는 B2B 도입을 중심으로 협의를 진행 중이다. 그리디는 정식 출시 기념으로 기존 유료 구독자 포함 신규 가입자에게 그리디 프로그램에서 사용할 수 있는 크레딧을 2배 제공하는 이벤트를 진행 중이다.</p>\n<p>정민규 커널스페이스 대표는 “커널스페이스는 실무자 개인의 AI 경쟁력을 높이는 제품을 만드는 것을 목표로 하고 있다”며 “그리디는 실무자들이 단순 반복 업무에서 벗어나 더 중요한 판단에 집중함으로써 자신의 생산성과 AI 시대에 시장 가치를 함께 높일 수 있도록 돕는 도구가 될 것”이라고 밝혔다.</p>",

Swap steps in with a single operating system that pulls returns handling, international shipping, demand predictions powered by AI, tax processing, and payments into one easy dashboard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brands using it hold onto 12% more cash and see sales jump 111% year over year, as seen with shops like The Frankie Shop and Pangaia. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fresh off a $40 million Series B from <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/anthropic-5b-funding-iconiq-170b-valuation-ethical-ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ICONIQ</a> six months ago, Swap just raised  $100 million Series C, co-led by <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/voda-snaps-650k-to-expand-lgbtqia-mental-health-support-amid-global-challenges/\">DST Global</a> and ICONIQ. Having evolved from its early days as a returns-focused platform, Swap expanded into cross-border last year, laying the groundwork for an AI commerce infrastructure that allows agents to transact, recommend, and process payments across merchants globally. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"building-the-central-system-every-brand-relies-on\">Building the central system every brand relies on</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-atkinson-5281aa142/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Atkinson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/zach-bailet/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Zach Bailet</a> started Swap in 2022 after their online store, Slow Goods, failed. They tried to bring handmade crafts from Africa to the UK and beyond, only to be hit by duty fees, fragmented shipping carriers, and return headaches no one tool could fix.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, they set out to help mid-sized brands from $5 million to $100 million in sales operate anywhere in the world, guess customer needs ahead of time, and close more deals without big-company hassles. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swap runs on smart AI that works on its own to streamline business: it locks in exact import costs upfront as the official importer, refunds taxes automatically on returns, predicts stock needs to avoid shortages, and offers virtual fitting rooms that lift sales by 65% and trim returns. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Atkinson explains to <em>TFN</em>, &#8220;Swap is built as an agentic commerce operating system — not another point tool. What sets our technology apart is that we’ve designed Swap to orchestrate the full operational stack behind modern ecommerce, with shared data, shared workflows, and AI-native automation across modules.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What sets it apart is stitching everything together, built right into Shopify for 30% better margins and near-perfect customer stickiness, minus the steep prices or bad service elsewhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Most solutions on the market address only one slice of the problem — returns, shipping, tax, protection, or planning — and brands end up stitching together vendors, reconciling data across systems, and manually managing gaps. Swap replaces that patchwork with an integrated OS that connects the pieces that actually depend on each other,&#8221; Atkinson elaborates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike Aftership, Loop, and Redo, Swap runs the whole show from start to finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whats-next\">What&#8217;s next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The funding sends Swap racing into markets outside the US, EU, Australia, and Canada, targeting niches such as beauty products, home items, and gadgets that lack strong options. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><br /><em>TFN contacted Swap for comment regarding diversity and inclusion; no response was received at the time of publication.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

Now, that expectation has become reality. The round closed above target shows how quickly Elon Musk’s venture has moved from challenger to prominent player in the global AI race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>xAI initially set out to secure $15 billion. Instead, investor demand pushed the round to $20 billion, a scale that could lift the company’s valuation beyond $230 billion, according to people familiar with the deal. For a company founded in 2023, that pace is extraordinary, even by Silicon Valley standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before this $20 billion round, xAI had already tested investor appetite. Earlier funding valued the company at <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/elon-musk-s-ai-rockets-to-200b-valuation-with-10b-funding-launches-grok-4-fast/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">around $200 billion after a $10 billion raise</a>, coinciding with the launch of Grok 4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The funding will be used to expand what xAI calls its decisive compute advantage. In practice, that means doubling down on large-scale data centres and the infrastructure needed to train increasingly complex models.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-capital-keeps-flooding-the-same-few-players\"><strong>Why capital keeps flooding the same few players</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The deal lands amid a record concentration of venture funding. PitchBook data shows that nearly two-thirds of venture capital deployed in the <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/openai-anthropic-xai-ai-funding-trends-2025/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">first nine months of 2025 went into AI</a>. But the real story is where that money ends up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foundational model companies xAI alongside <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/openai-to-raise-massive-funding-at-750b-valuation-with-big-infrastructure-plans/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/anthropic-raises-13b-series-f/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Anthropic</a> have absorbed the bulk of investor attention. Together, they now account for close to $1 trillion in private market value, turning AI into a scale-driven contest where only a handful of firms can realistically compete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>xAI’s backers in the latest round include <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/oura-raises-hits-11b-valuation-becomes-europes-first-health-tracking-decacorn/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fidelity</a>, the <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/firgun-ventures-250m-quantum-vc-fund-qatar-investment-authority/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Qatar Investment Authority</a>, <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/commercial-trucking-insurer-nirvana-insurance-hits-1-5b-valuation-with-100m-funding/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Valor Equity Partners</a>, and Nvidia. Total funding now exceeds $42 billion, showing that investors see xAI less as a startup and more as emerging infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"speed-and-scale-are-the-big-bets\"><strong>Speed and scale are the big bets</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Elon Musk’s return to AI has been anything but quiet. After co-founding OpenAI and later splitting amid disagreements with Sam Altman, Musk entered a market already dominated by mature products from OpenAI and Google. His response was speed and scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>xAI built major data centres in Memphis and launched Grok, a chatbot deliberately positioned as more provocative than its rivals. That edge has drawn attention and backlash over offensive outputs and controversial behaviour. A new model, Grok 5, is due early this year, with Musk publicly assigning it a 10% chance of reaching artificial general intelligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside the technology push, Musk has escalated legal battles against OpenAI and Apple, accusing them of anticompetitive conduct, cases that remain unresolved. For xAI, the message is consistent and it is growth, conflict, and capital are all part of the same strategy.</p>",

San Francisco-based LMArena flipped that logic early. Instead of synthetic tests or narrowly defined scores, it lets everyday users judge models on real prompts, real tasks, and real expectations. A user types a question, two anonymous models respond, and a single choice determines which one performed better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, LMArena has raised $150 million in a funding round, valuing it at $1.7 billion. This is nearly triple its valuation after its May 2025 seed round. The round was led by <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/factorial-capital-25m-fund-ii-technical-ai-founders-citadel-model/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Felicis</a> and UC Investments, with participation from <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/andreessen-horowitz-targets-10b-fund-to-fuel-ai-and-defence-tech-startups/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Andreessen Horowitz</a>, The House Fund, LDVP, <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/reevo-raises-80m-to-replace-fragmented-sales-tools-with-one-connected-platform/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kleiner</a><a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/reevo-raises-80m-to-replace-fragmented-sales-tools-with-one-connected-platform/\"> Perkins</a>, <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/lightspeed-invests-in-london-based-gen-ai-unicorn-stability-ais-80m-round/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lightspeed</a><a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/lightspeed-invests-in-london-based-gen-ai-unicorn-stability-ais-80m-round/\"> Venture Partners</a>, and Laude Ventures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The capital will support platform operations, technical hiring, and deeper research. More importantly, it reinforces LMArena’s core bet: in an industry crowded with claims of intelligence, progress is best measured by how models perform in the hands of people who actually use them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-leaderboard-rankings-mattered\"><strong>Why leaderboard rankings mattered</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the number of large language models exploded, LMArena’s rankings became a proxy for credibility. A rise or fall on the leaderboard could shape developer adoption, media narratives, and enterprise interest. Model makers began watching the results closely, sometimes obsessively. The influence also brought scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When LMArena partnered with select companies,&nbsp; including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, to make flagship models available for evaluation, critics questioned whether access created bias. In April, a group of competitors published a paper alleging that the setup allowed certain players to game the benchmarks. LMArena strongly denied the claims, but the episode highlighted how consequential its platform had become.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"turning-community-judgment-into-a-business\"><strong>Turning community judgment into a business</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What started as an open research experiment at UC Berkeley, led by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ml-angelopoulos\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Anastasios Angelopoulos</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/wei-lin-chiang-51b025b2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Wei-Lin Chiang</a>, evolved into a massive public signal of model quality. Today, more than five million monthly users across 150 countries generate around 60 million head-to-head comparisons each month. Those judgments power LMArena’s leaderboards, which rank models across text, web development, vision, text-to-image, and other practical tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September, LMArena took a decisive step by launching AI Evaluations, a commercial service that allows enterprises, developers, and model labs to commission evaluations using its community-driven framework. Within four months, the service reached an annualised consumption rate of $30 million, showing how much the market values independent, human-in-the-loop assessment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We cannot deploy AI responsibly without knowing how it delivers value to humans,&#8221; said Anastasios Angelopoulos, co-founder and CEO of LMArena. &#8220;To measure the real utility of AI, we need to put it in the hands of real users. LMArena does exactly this, leveraging feedback from tens of millions of consumers and professionals to set the North Star of the AI industry. Our evaluations use a transparent, open-source methodology to make these insights public for everyone. This funding accelerates the scientific work and community insights that make live evaluation from real users the gold standard for assessing AI in practice.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Without a trustworthy way to measure performance, AI can&#8217;t be safely scaled,&#8221; said Jagdeep Singh Bachher, the University of California&#8217;s chief investment officer. &#8220;LMArena delivers clarity and confidence for researchers, developers and businesses. As AI adoption accelerates, LMArena&#8217;s tools are becoming critical infrastructure.&#8221;</p>",

      "full_content": "OpenAI announced ChatGPT Health on Wednesday, which the company said will offer a dedicated space for users to have conversations with ChatGPT about their health. People already use ChatGPT to ask about medical issues; OpenAI says that over 230 million people ask health and wellness questions on the platform each week. But the ChatGPT Health product silos these conversations away from your other chats. That way, the context of your health won&#8217;t come up in standard conversations with ChatGPT. If people start chats about their health outside of the Health section, then the AI aims to nudge them to switch over. Within Health, the AI might reference things you&#8217;ve discussed in its standard experience. If you ask ChatGPT for help constructing a marathon training plan, for example, then the AI would know you&#8217;re a runner when you talk in Health about your fitness goals. ChatGPT Health will also be able to integrate with your personal information or medical records from wellness apps like Apple Health, Function, and MyFitnessPal. OpenAI notes that it will not use Health conversations to train its models. The CEO of Applications at OpenAI, Fidji Simo, wrote in a blog post that she sees ChatGPT Health as a response to existing issues in the healthcare space, like cost and access barriers, overbooked doctors, and a lack of continuity in care. While the healthcare system has its drawbacks, using AI chatbots for medical advice creates a new slew of challenges. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT operate by predicting the most likely response to prompts, not the most correct answer, since LLMs don&#8217;t have a concept of what is true or not. AI models are also prone to hallucinations . In its own terms of service, OpenAI states that it is &#8220;not intended for use in the diagnosis or treatment of any health condition.&#8221; The feature is expected to roll out in the coming weeks.

      "full_content": "In Brief Posted: 10:36 AM PST · January 7, 2026 Image Credits: Getty Images Rebecca Bellan Anthropic reportedly raising $10B at $350B valuation Anthropic is gearing up to raise a fresh $10 billion at a $350 billion valuation, according to The Wall Street Journal . TechCrunch has confirmed the raise and valuation, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Claude maker last raised a $13 billion Series F round at a $183 billion valuation three months ago, so this raise nearly doubles the AI firm’s value. In March, Anthropic secured $3.5 billion at a $61.5 billion valuation. Coatue Management and GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, will lead the new round, per the WSJ, which cited sources familiar with the deal. Anthropic is expected to close its latest financing in the coming weeks, and the total deal amount could change. This round would be separate from the $15 billion Nvidia and Microsoft recently committed to invest in Anthropic, a “circular” deal that would see Anthropic buying $30 billion of compute capacity from Microsoft Azure running on Nvidia’s chips. The fresh capital comes as Anthropic continues to win over developer hearts with Claude Code , its tool designed to automate coding, powered by Claude Opus 4.5. It also comes as Anthropic prepares for a potential IPO this year alongside its main rival OpenAI . OpenAI is also in talks to raise as much as $100 billion at a valuation of up to $830 billion . Anthropic declined to comment. This article was updated to reflect that TechCrunch separately confirmed the round.

      "full_content": "Skylight may have started as a digital picture frame, but today, the company is more focused on helping families stay organized with shared calendars, lists, meal planning tools, and more. At CES 2026, the company debuted its latest product: the Skylight Calendar 2, which offers a sleeker design than the original 15-inch calendar but smaller than the 27-inch wall-mounted Calendar Max. Like its larger counterpart, the new digital calendar app and family organizer also lets you swap out the frame for different colors to better match your home’s decor. The biggest selling point isn’t the digital screen itself, but the underlying software and AI capabilities. The primary feature — the calendar — is actually a mashup of all your family’s calendars from whatever services you use, whether that’s Google Calendar, iCal, Microsoft, or even your kids’ sports apps, like TeamSnap. The calendar is color-coded to see everyone’s schedules at a glance, and can even import “calendars” that are really just emails with a few key dates or flyers sent home in Junior’s backpack. (The latter is an AI feature where you snap a photo of the paper, and the calendar updates with the new events.) Image Credits: Sarah Perez The company is also trying to address other pain points for families, such as managing grocery lists, reminders for appointments, meal planning, and recipe discovery. Of course, it can still display your family photos too, when otherwise not in use. The app is well-designed to be easy to read with simple navigation, pops of color, and imagery that makes it possible for little kids to use. For instance, they can check off their chores by looking for a picture, even if they can’t yet read. Parents also like the ability to plan meals, whether that’s noting simply that Tuesday will be taco night, or going as far as finding a recipe and preparing a shopping list. Skylight’s helpful here too, as it can automatically create the shopping list of ingredients for you or even add it to your Instacart app. Another clever AI feature lets you snap a photo of what’s in your fridge and get a recipe recommendation based on what you have on hand. The need for such a system is clearly resonating with customers. Skylight, a bootstrapped and profitable company from day one, now has 1.3 million-plus families using its digital calendars so far, and likely more to come as the new design ships.

      "full_content": "Google has introduced a new way to grab the attention of students who are avid podcast listeners. Now available in Google Classroom, teachers can use a new Gemini-powered tool that generates podcast-style audio lessons, meant to promote deeper comprehension of educational material. To begin, educators simply go to the Gemini tab within Google Classroom. There, they can select different customization options, such as selecting the appropriate grade level, defining topics, and setting clear learning objectives. They can then further personalize the audio experience by choosing the number of speakers or selecting different conversational styles, such as interviews, roundtable discussions, or casual dialogues. This new feature is currently available to users subscribed to Google Workspace Education Fundamentals, Standard, and Plus. By bringing this familiar format into the classroom, teachers can tap into their students’ interests. Research shows that students spend significant time listening to podcasts, with an estimated 35 million Gen Z monthly listeners in the U.S. Plus, the popularity of podcasts as educational resources has grown rapidly; many universities now produce their own podcasts, and students increasingly seek out popular educational series on their own time. Podcast-style lessons might also encourage independent learning, since students can replay episodes whenever they need a refresher or missed a class. However, teachers are still grappling with integrating AI tools into their teaching practices. Many teachers express concerns about students’ increased reliance on generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to complete assignments. Google urges teachers to practice responsible AI and carefully review and, if necessary, edit all AI-generated content to ensure accuracy and appropriateness for their specific classroom context and local policies.

      "full_content": "Caterpillar is digging deeper into incorporating AI and automation into its fleet of construction machinery through a partnership with semiconductor giant Nvidia. The construction equipment giant is piloting an AI assistive system in its mid-size Cat 306 CR Mini Excavator. Dubbed &#8220;Cat AI,&#8221; the system was built using Nvidia&#8217;s Jetson Thor physical AI platform, and is being demoed at CES on Wednesday. Brandon Hootman, vice president of data and AI at Caterpillar, told TechCrunch that Cat AI was built on a fleet of AI agents and can help answer a machine operator&#8217;s questions, allow them to access resources, offer safety tips, and schedule services. One of the biggest benefits of bringing this tech into these machines is the data that these systems collect and send back out. &#8220;Our customers don&#8217;t live in front of a laptop day in and day out; they live in the dirt,&#8221; Hootman said. &#8220;The ability to get the insights and take the action that they need while they&#8217;re doing the work is very important to them.&#8221; Caterpillar is also piloting digital twins of construction sites using Nvidia&#8217;s Omniverse library of simulation resources to test scheduling scenarios and better calculate how much building material a project will need. Hootman said Caterpillar&#8217;s machines send roughly 2,000 messages back to the company every second. This data will help them build these simulations. The company already has fully autonomous vehicles in the mining sector , and Hootman said that these pilot programs are a great next step as the company looks to bring more automation to its portfolio.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 W AITLIST NOW &#8220;The reason that we started here was it was a real challenge of our customers today that needed to be addressed, and also something that we had some real momentum on and we felt like we could bring to market pretty quickly,&#8221; Hootman said. &#8220;What we also liked is that it provided a kind of a technology foundation for us to then build upon.&#8221; Working with companies like Caterpillar — a legacy brand that doesn&#8217;t often intertwine with the tech industry — seems to fit right into Nvidia&#8217;s physical AI strategy. Bill Dally, Nvidia&#8217;s chief scientist, told TechCrunch in 2025 that the chipmaker considers physical AI to be the next frontier for the company and its powerful GPUs. During its CES keynote on Monday, Nvidia laid out plans for its full-stack ecosystem for physical AI , which includes open AI models like the company&#8217;s Cosmos model family , simulation tools, and developer kits. While some may think physical AI is just for robotics companies, Deepu Talla, the vice president of robotics and edge AI at Nvidia, told TechCrunch the company takes a much broader definition as everyone is building robotics today. &#8220;Physical AI is the next wave of AI,&#8221; Talla said. &#8220;Nvidia is pioneering that with computers that train the models, that do the simulation to test the models and deploy the models into the robots, whether [that&#8217;s] an autonomous car or a Caterpillar machine.&#8221; Follow along with all of TechCrunch&#8217;s CES coverage here .

      "full_content": "Articul8 , an enterprise AI company spun out of Intel in early 2024 , has secured more than half of a planned $70 million funding round at a $500 million pre-money valuation, according to its CEO, as it looks to capitalize on growing demand for AI systems in regulated industries. The Series B funding round is structured in two installments, with the first led by Spain&#8217;s Adara Ventures, Articul8 founder and CEO Arun K. Subramaniyan (pictured above, center) said in an interview. He declined to disclose the size of the initial installment, but said the company expects to close the round in the first quarter of this year. Articul8&#8217;s valuation for its current funding round marks a roughly fivefold increase from the company&#8217;s $100 million post-money Series A valuation in January 2024. Since then, the Santa Clara-based company said it has surpassed $90 million in total contract value &#8212; the cumulative value of all signed customer contracts &#8212; from 29 paying customers, including Hitachi Energy, AWS, Franklin Templeton, and Intel. Subramaniyan told TechCrunch that Articul8 was not under pressure to raise capital, describing the company as revenue-positive following a series of large enterprise contracts. &#8220;We are not cash-strapped,&#8221; he said. The company expects to finish the year with annual recurring revenue of just over $57 million, Subramaniyan said, with roughly 45% to 50% of that already recognized. Articul8 develops specialized AI systems that operate within customers&#8217; own IT environments, rather than relying on shared, general-purpose models. Instead of selling standalone models, the company packages its technology as software applications and AI agents tailored to specific business functions, targeting regulated industries such as energy, manufacturing, aerospace, financial services, and semiconductors, where accuracy, auditability, and data control are critical.

Articul8 plans to use the Series B proceeds primarily to expand research and product development and to scale its operations internationally, with a focus on Europe and parts of Asia. Adara Ventures&#8217; participation will help speed-up the European expansion plan, as the European Investment Fund backs the Madrid-based VC firm&#8217;s energy fund, Subramaniyan said. The company is also looking to scale in markets including Japan and South Korea, where it has begun working with large enterprise customers, he noted. India&#8217;s Aditya Birla Ventures also participated in the ongoing round, Subramaniyan stated. Articul8 works with large tech groups including Nvidia and Google Cloud, Subramaniyan said, adding that Amazon Web Services is both a customer and a partner for the company on some deployments. The company employs 75 people, with about 80% focused on R&D, and teams spread across the U.S., Brazil, and India.

While the startup has both India and US entities, it operates largely out of India.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded by Devyani Gupta and Vengadanathan Srinivasan in 2022, Arrowhead is an AI startup that builds and deploys voice AI agents that aid the sales functions for banks, NBFCs as well as fintech companies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These AI agents handle end-to-end sales and service calls, often running for up to 20 minutes, without customers realising they are speaking to an AI bot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The startup said the fresh capital will be used mainly for hiring and technology development. It is also worth noting that the startup is rapidly expanding its team across engineering, data science, customer success, and new customer acquisition roles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Its second focus area is building  a deeper tech differentiation for its bots by fine-tuning its AI model in-house and expanding its product beyond basic voice automation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arrowhead operates across three core BFSI segments — lending, insurance and securities. While its bots are used for loan sales and collections for lending, their use case for the insurance segment is handling health, life and motor insurance sales as well as renewals. For securities, the startup works on use cases such as mutual funds and fixed deposit sales.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the startup, its voice AI agents deliver up to 45% higher conversion rates than human agents. These bots handle complex calls that involve explaining policy details, coverages and exclusions, often referencing policy documents that can run into 20 pages. These bots are able to conduct long conversations without breaking flow or compliance, which has allowed some clients to displace human agents entirely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A key part of Arrowhead’s product is its support for Indian regional languages. The bots currently operate in Hindi, English, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada and Bengali, and can switch languages mid-call. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This, the startup said, helps reduce customer drop-offs that typically happen when a human agent cannot communicate efficiently in a customer’s preferred language.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the business side, the startup claims to have grown its revenue by 4X over the last few months, driven by a rise in go-live contracts. While it did not disclose absolute numbers, the startup expects demand for voice AI in BFSI to grow sharply over the next 6–12 months as banks and fintechs start treating AI-led calling as a baseline requirement rather than an optional add-on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It currently claims to work with over 50 BFSI clients, including Bank of Baroda Cards, Aditya Birla Capital, Paytm, Turtlemint, Kissht, InsuranceDekho and others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond India, Arrowhead operates in Southeast Asia and has active deployments with a large bank and a collections firm in Malaysia. While India remains its main market, the startup plans to expand further across Southeast Asia and the Middle East over the next year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The investor interest for Arrowhead comes at a time when voice agents have gained more fervour across businesses in 2025. In the previous year, these agents moved from basic IVR and scripted bots to systems that could handle long, natural conversations with minimal human support. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For these agents, BFSI saw the strongest traction. Banks, NBFCs and insurers have now begun using voice agents to replace large calling teams, improve reach and drive higher conversions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the notable funding rounds include Giga’s $61 Mn and smallest.ai’s $8 Mn round late last year. </span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://inc42.com/buzz/arrowhead-raises-3-mn-to-scale-voice-ai-for-bfsi-sales/\" title=\"Arrowhead Raises $3 Mn To Scale Voice AI For BFSI Sales\">Arrowhead Raises $3 Mn To Scale Voice AI For BFSI Sales</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://inc42.com\">Inc42 Media</a>.</p>",

Designed for fast-paced and crowded surgical settings, the system is intended to help anesthesiologists stay focused on patients while reducing cognitive load, alarm fatigue, and the risk of <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-features/how-an-ai-tool-is-quietly-fixing-prescription-errors/\">human error</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second concept targets neonatal care through intelligent, live monitoring powered by agentic edge AI. The system is designed to detect events such as an infant crying or resting, the presence of unwanted objects in the crib, or changes in sleeping position.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All image processing is performed locally on the device using models built with NXP’s eIQ AI Toolkit, ensuring that no images leave the device and supporting security and privacy requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both concepts are built on NXP application processors with integrated neural processing units (NPUs), alongside a dedicated standalone NPU, and are guided by GE HealthCare’s Responsible AI principles, including safety, security, privacy, transparency, and fairness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“At GE HealthCare, we build AI that keeps clinicians at the center, assisting clinical judgment and freeing up time for patient care,” Jeff Caron, chief digital and technology officer, Patient Care Solutions, GE HealthCare, said. He added that working with NXP enables exploration of secure <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/google-introduces-private-ai-compute-for-on-device-gemini-capabilities/\">on-device AI</a> to complement cloud-based solutions in acute care environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charles Dachs, executive VP and GM, Secure Connected Edge at NXP, said the collaboration brings together clinical trust and edge AI expertise to deliver practical, secure solutions. “Together, we aim to enable more personalised care, from continuous monitoring in the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) and hands-free interaction with anaesthesia equipment to exploratory research concepts such as AI-driven risk prediction, automated triage, and personalised treatment recommendations,” he said.The companies said the concepts demonstrate how <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com/it-services/enabling-edge-ai-through-future-ready-software-development-kit/\">edge AI</a> can play a growing role in transforming acute care by delivering timely insights, strengthening data privacy, and supporting clinicians in high-stakes medical settings.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/nxp-ge-healthcare-partner-to-advance-edge-ai-for-acute-care-at-ces-2026/\">NXP, GE HealthCare Partner to Advance Edge AI for Acute Care at CES 2026</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com\">Analytics India Magazine</a>.</p>",

What’s exciting is how quickly financial institutions are now moving from pilots to full-scale adoption,” she added.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform is designed for natural, compliant conversations and strong responses at scale. From August to October last year, Arrowhead achieved a fivefold increase in ARR, it stated, and boasted that every proof-of-concept has moved to a live deployment without losing a single POC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arrowhead cited deploying its voice AI bots to a large financial institution that carried out full health insurance sales calls, achieving 45% higher conversion rates than human agents and replacing manual operations. Additionally, Arrowhead enabled a financial services firm to contact 100% of its customers for insurance renewals, resulting in a 20% increase in renewal rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arrowhead operates in India and Southeast Asia, serving over 50 clients in various banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) applications. The company partners with major institutions like Bank of Baroda Cards, Aditya Birla Capital, and Paytm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next 12–18 months, Arrowhead plans to improve its BFSI conversational models, enhance infrastructure to support tens of thousands of simultaneous calls with sub-500ms speech latency, and develop emotion-aware voice agents, transitioning into an omnichannel customer interaction platform across chat, calls, and messaging, the company said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vardhan Dharnidharka, principal at Stellaris Venture Partners, added in the statement, “Voice AI for the financial sector in India alone represents a $3 billion market, with less than $50 million penetrated so far, highlighting how early we still are in this transition.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/bengaluru-startup-arrowhead-raises-3-mn-to-expand-voice-ai-capabilities/\">Bengaluru Startup Arrowhead Raises $3 Mn to Expand Voice AI Capabilities</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com\">Analytics India Magazine</a>.</p>",

Mobile and Telecoms Top Stories January 7, 2026 Updated: January 7, 2026 Introducing Lenovo and Motorola Qira, a Personal Ambient Intelligence Designed to Work Across Devices By Mamsi Nkosi Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp - Advertisement - Lenovo just announced a significant departure from the chatbot model dominating the AI space. Unveiled at the CES 2026, Lenovo introduced a single, built-in cross-device intelligence designed to redefine how people interact with their devices, applications, and digital services. This Personal Ambient Intelligence launches as Lenovo Qira and Motorola Qira on respective devices. “Lenovo Qira is not another assistant; it’s a new way intelligence shows up across your devices,” said Dan Dery , VP of AI Ecosystem in Lenovo&#8217;s Intelligent Devices Group . “Our goal is to make AI feel less like a tool you use and more like an intelligence that works with you, continuously and naturally.” Lenovo Qira represents a shift from app-based AI to ambient system-level intelligence, meaning intelligence that is context-aware and available across devices without requiring users to open, switch to, or actively invoke a separate application. It isn’t something you open or switch to. It’s always present: understanding what you’re doing and supporting you in the moment, with your permission. By sharing experiences with you over time, it learns your intent, anticipates needs, and acts in ways that feel natural and personal. One Intelligence, Across All Your Devices Lenovo Qira is a single intelligence carried consistently across Lenovo and Motorola devices. Embedded at the system level, it moves with you across PCs, tablets, smartphones, wearables, and more, maintaining continuity as you shift screens, tasks, and environments. Built on three core attributes, Lenovo Qira operates as a true cross-device intelligence, unlike traditional chatbots. Presence Lenovo Qira is integrated at the system level with multiple natural entry points and a familiar, consistent experience across devices. It can proactively surface suggestions, respond instantly when invoked, or stay quietly in the background until needed, adapting to how and when each user prefers to engage. It can be invoked naturally by saying “Hey, Qira,” pressing the dedicated key or tapping the persistent pill. Actions Lenovo Qira can act on the user’s behalf using device capabilities and local AI, including offline, to get things done. It orchestrates actions across apps and devices, coordinates agents, and moves work forward without forcing users to manage every step themselves. Perception Lenovo Qira builds a fused knowledge base that combines user-selected interactions, memories, and documents across devices with user privacy and consent at its core. Through cross-device sensing and perception, it develops a living model of the user’s world, understanding context, continuity, and personal patterns over time. Designed Around Real Moments Lenovo Qira introduces a set of core experiences designed around real user needs, helping people stay oriented, expressive, and in flow across their digital lives. Next Move Whenever you need it, Lenovo Qira offers proactive, contextual suggestions based on what you’re doing in the moment, with continuity across devices evolving over time. It surfaces useful next actions to help you move forward without extra steps. Write For Me From emails and documents to messages and notes, Lenovo Qira helps you write directly on your canvas. It understands what you’re working on, adapts to your tone and intent, and helps you turn ideas into crisp writing, without forcing you to start from a blank page or switch apps. Live Interaction Lenovo Qira enables real-time, multimodal interaction while you are sharing your screen or camera. It stays attentive to what you say and what you show, making collaboration with AI feel fluid and conversational. Catch Me Up Step away and come back without losing momentum. Lenovo Qira summarizes what happened while you were away, highlights what matters, and helps you re-enter your work or conversations with clarity and confidence. Pay Attention Lenovo Qira can support meetings and conversations by providing real-time transcriptions and translations when enabled, capturing key points, and creating summaries you can revisit later. When you need to recall decisions or details, they are brought back instantly. For moments that require deeper immersion, focused AI experiences like Creator Zone help users create and edit visuals and photos with fewer distractions and greater creative control. Privacy and Ecosystem Lenovo Qira is built with privacy by design. Its hybrid AI architecture prioritizes on-device processing to keep personal data local, while secure cloud services extend capabilities with strong safeguards and user control. The Lenovo Qira experience is designed to be secure, ethical, and accountable. Lenovo Qira is powered by a growing ecosystem of industry-leading partners, adding specialized intelligence where it matters most while preserving one consistent, familiar experience across devices. Microsoft’s AI stack through Windows Foundry and Microsoft Azure, provides secure and trusted local-to-cloud capabilities that enable seamless coordination across Windows PCs, tablets, and smartphones. In Creator Zone on PCs, Stability AI enables private, unlimited on-device text-to-image creation using the latest Stable Diffusion 3.5 Flash models, with hybrid support for advanced generative workflows. Notion enables Lenovo Qira users to securely search and reason over a user’s Notion workspace, bringing notes, documents, and plans directly into context, powering a truly fused personal knowledge base. Perplexity&#8217;s AI adds the ability for users to dive deeper into a topic with clear, well-sourced answers and guided follow-ups deepen contextual understanding without breaking focus or switching apps. With Expedia Group’s brands, Expedia and Vrbo , Lenovo Qira can surface relevant travel inventory based on a user’s intent, with seamless handoff for booking and servicing, making trip planning faster and easier. Availability This experience will appear as Lenovo Qira on Lenovo devices and Motorola Qira on Motorola devices, delivering one personal AI across products and form factors.

      "contents": "Nous Research , the open-source artificial intelligence startup backed by crypto venture firm Paradigm , released a new competitive programming model on Monday that it says matches or exceeds several larger proprietary systems — trained in just four days using 48 of Nvidia&#x27;s latest B200 graphics processors . The model, called NousCoder-14B , is another entry in a crowded field of AI coding assistants, but arrives at a particularly charged moment: Claude Code , the agentic programming tool from rival Anthropic, has dominated social media discussion since New Year&#x27;s Day, with developers posting breathless testimonials about its capabilities . The simultaneous developments underscore how quickly AI-assisted software development is evolving — and how fiercely companies large and small are competing to capture what many believe will become a foundational technology for how software gets written. type: embedded-entry-inline id: 74cSyrq6OUrp9SEQ5zOUSl NousCoder-14B achieves a 67.87 percent accuracy rate on LiveCodeBench v6 , a standardized evaluation that tests models on competitive programming problems published between August 2024 and May 2025. That figure represents a 7.08 percentage point improvement over the base model it was trained from, Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen3-14B , according to Nous Research&#x27;s technical report published alongside the release. \"I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour,\" wrote Jaana Dogan , a principal engineer at Google responsible for the Gemini API, in a viral post on X last week that captured the prevailing mood around AI coding tools. Dogan was describing a distributed agent orchestration system her team had spent a year developing — a system Claude Code approximated from a three-paragraph prompt. The juxtaposition is instructive: while Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Code has captured imaginations with demonstrations of end-to-end software development, Nous Research is betting that open-source alternatives trained on verifiable problems can close the gap — and that transparency in how these models are built matters as much as raw capability. How Nous Research built an AI coding model that anyone can replicate What distinguishes the NousCoder-14B release from many competitor announcements is its radical openness. Nous Research published not just the model weights but the complete reinforcement learning environment , benchmark suite, and training harness — built on the company&#x27;s Atropos framework — enabling any researcher with sufficient compute to reproduce or extend the work . \"Open-sourcing the Atropos stack provides the necessary infrastructure for reproducible olympiad-level reasoning research,\" noted one observer on X , summarizing the significance for the academic and open-source communities. The model was trained by Joe Li , a researcher in residence at Nous Research and a former competitive programmer himself. Li&#x27;s technical report reveals an unexpectedly personal dimension: he compared the model&#x27;s improvement trajectory to his own journey on Codeforces, the competitive programming platform where participants earn ratings based on contest performance. Based on rough estimates mapping LiveCodeBench scores to Codeforces ratings, Li calculated that NousCoder-14B&#x27;s improvemen t— from approximately the 1600-1750 rating range to 2100-2200 — mirrors a leap that took him nearly two years of sustained practice between ages 14 and 16. The model accomplished the equivalent in four days. \"Watching that final training run unfold was quite a surreal experience,\" Li wrote in the technical report. But Li was quick to note an important caveat that speaks to broader questions about AI efficiency: he solved roughly 1,000 problems during those two years, while the model required 24,000. Humans, at least for now, remain dramatically more sample-efficient learners. Inside the reinforcement learning system that trains on 24,000 competitive programming problems NousCoder-14B &#x27;s training process offers a window into the increasingly sophisticated techniques researchers use to improve AI reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning. The approach relies on what researchers call \"verifiable rewards\" — a system where the model generates code solutions, those solutions are executed against test cases, and the model receives a simple binary signal: correct or incorrect. This feedback loop, while conceptually straightforward, requires significant infrastructure to execute at scale. Nous Research used Modal , a cloud computing platform, to run sandboxed code execution in parallel. Each of the 24,000 training problems contains hundreds of test cases on average, and the system must verify that generated code produces correct outputs within time and memory constraints — 15 seconds and 4 gigabytes, respectively. The training employed a technique called DAPO (Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization) , which the researchers found performed slightly better than alternatives in their experiments. A key innovation involves \"dynamic sampling\" — discarding training examples where the model either solves all attempts or fails all attempts, since these provide no useful gradient signal for learning. The researchers also adopted \"iterative context extension,\" first training the model with a 32,000-token context window before expanding to 40,000 tokens. During evaluation, extending the context further to approximately 80,000 tokens produced the best results, with accuracy reaching 67.87 percent. Perhaps most significantly, the training pipeline overlaps inference and verification — as soon as the model generates a solution, it begins work on the next problem while the previous solution is being checked. This pipelining, combined with asynchronous training where multiple model instances work in parallel, maximizes hardware utilization on expensive GPU clusters. The looming data shortage that could slow AI coding model progress Buried in Li&#x27;s technical report is a finding with significant implications for the future of AI development: the training dataset for NousCoder-14B encompasses \"a significant portion of all readily available, verifiable competitive programming problems in a standardized dataset format.\" In other words, for this particular domain, the researchers are approaching the limits of high-quality training data. \"The total number of competitive programming problems on the Internet is roughly the same order of magnitude,\" Li wrote, referring to the 24,000 problems used for training. \"This suggests that within the competitive programming domain, we have approached the limits of high-quality data.\" This observation echoes growing concern across the AI industry about data constraints. While compute continues to scale according to well-understood economic and engineering principles, training data is \"increasingly finite,\" as Li put it. \"It appears that some of the most important research that needs to be done in the future will be in the areas of synthetic data generation and data efficient algorithms and architectures,\" he concluded. The challenge is particularly acute for competitive programming because the domain requires problems with known correct solutions that can be verified automatically. Unlike natural language tasks where human evaluation or proxy metrics suffice, code either works or it doesn&#x27;t — making synthetic data generation considerably more difficult. Li identified one potential avenue: training models not just to solve problems but to generate solvable problems, enabling a form of self-play similar to techniques that proved successful in game-playing AI systems. \"Once synthetic problem generation is solved, self-play becomes a very interesting direction,\" he wrote. A $65 million bet that open-source AI can compete with Big Tech Nous Research has carved out a distinctive position in the AI landscape: a company committed to open-source releases that compete with — and sometimes exceed — proprietary alternatives. The company raised $50 million in April 2025 in a round led by Paradigm, the cryptocurrency-focused venture firm founded by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam. Total funding reached $65 million, according to some reports. The investment reflected growing interest in decentralized approaches to AI training, an area where Nous Research has developed its Psyche platform . Previous releases include Hermes 4 , a family of models that we reported \" outperform ChatGPT without content restrictions ,\" and DeepHermes-3, which the company described as the first \" toggle-on reasoning model \" — allowing users to activate extended thinking capabilities on demand. The company has cultivated a distinctive aesthetic and community, prompting some skepticism about whether style might overshadow substance. \"Ofc i&#x27;m gonna believe an anime pfp company. stop benchmarkmaxxing ffs,\" wrote one critic on X , referring to Nous Research&#x27;s anime-style branding and the industry practice of optimizing for benchmark performance. Others raised technical questions. \" Based on the benchmark, Nemotron is better ,\" noted one commenter, referring to Nvidia&#x27;s family of language models.

      "full_content": "Michael Nuñez January 7, 2026 Credit: VentureBeat made with Midjourney Nous Research , the open-source artificial intelligence startup backed by crypto venture firm Paradigm , released a new competitive programming model on Monday that it says matches or exceeds several larger proprietary systems — trained in just four days using 48 of Nvidia&#x27;s latest B200 graphics processors . The model, called NousCoder-14B , is another entry in a crowded field of AI coding assistants, but arrives at a particularly charged moment: Claude Code , the agentic programming tool from rival Anthropic, has dominated social media discussion since New Year&#x27;s Day, with developers posting breathless testimonials about its capabilities . The simultaneous developments underscore how quickly AI-assisted software development is evolving — and how fiercely companies large and small are competing to capture what many believe will become a foundational technology for how software gets written. NousCoder-14B achieves a 67.87 percent accuracy rate on LiveCodeBench v6 , a standardized evaluation that tests models on competitive programming problems published between August 2024 and May 2025. That figure represents a 7.08 percentage point improvement over the base model it was trained from, Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen3-14B , according to Nous Research&#x27;s technical report published alongside the release. \"I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour,\" wrote Jaana Dogan , a principal engineer at Google responsible for the Gemini API, in a viral post on X last week that captured the prevailing mood around AI coding tools. Dogan was describing a distributed agent orchestration system her team had spent a year developing — a system Claude Code approximated from a three-paragraph prompt. The juxtaposition is instructive: while Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Code has captured imaginations with demonstrations of end-to-end software development, Nous Research is betting that open-source alternatives trained on verifiable problems can close the gap — and that transparency in how these models are built matters as much as raw capability. How Nous Research built an AI coding model that anyone can replicate What distinguishes the NousCoder-14B release from many competitor announcements is its radical openness. Nous Research published not just the model weights but the complete reinforcement learning environment , benchmark suite, and training harness — built on the company&#x27;s Atropos framework — enabling any researcher with sufficient compute to reproduce or extend the work . \"Open-sourcing the Atropos stack provides the necessary infrastructure for reproducible olympiad-level reasoning research,\" noted one observer on X , summarizing the significance for the academic and open-source communities. The model was trained by Joe Li , a researcher in residence at Nous Research and a former competitive programmer himself. Li&#x27;s technical report reveals an unexpectedly personal dimension: he compared the model&#x27;s improvement trajectory to his own journey on Codeforces, the competitive programming platform where participants earn ratings based on contest performance. Based on rough estimates mapping LiveCodeBench scores to Codeforces ratings, Li calculated that NousCoder-14B&#x27;s improvemen t— from approximately the 1600-1750 rating range to 2100-2200 — mirrors a leap that took him nearly two years of sustained practice between ages 14 and 16. The model accomplished the equivalent in four days. \"Watching that final training run unfold was quite a surreal experience,\" Li wrote in the technical report. But Li was quick to note an important caveat that speaks to broader questions about AI efficiency: he solved roughly 1,000 problems during those two years, while the model required 24,000. Humans, at least for now, remain dramatically more sample-efficient learners. Inside the reinforcement learning system that trains on 24,000 competitive programming problems NousCoder-14B &#x27;s training process offers a window into the increasingly sophisticated techniques researchers use to improve AI reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning. The approach relies on what researchers call \"verifiable rewards\" — a system where the model generates code solutions, those solutions are executed against test cases, and the model receives a simple binary signal: correct or incorrect. This feedback loop, while conceptually straightforward, requires significant infrastructure to execute at scale. Nous Research used Modal , a cloud computing platform, to run sandboxed code execution in parallel. Each of the 24,000 training problems contains hundreds of test cases on average, and the system must verify that generated code produces correct outputs within time and memory constraints — 15 seconds and 4 gigabytes, respectively. The training employed a technique called DAPO (Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization) , which the researchers found performed slightly better than alternatives in their experiments. A key innovation involves \"dynamic sampling\" — discarding training examples where the model either solves all attempts or fails all attempts, since these provide no useful gradient signal for learning. The researchers also adopted \"iterative context extension,\" first training the model with a 32,000-token context window before expanding to 40,000 tokens. During evaluation, extending the context further to approximately 80,000 tokens produced the best results, with accuracy reaching 67.87 percent. Perhaps most significantly, the training pipeline overlaps inference and verification — as soon as the model generates a solution, it begins work on the next problem while the previous solution is being checked. This pipelining, combined with asynchronous training where multiple model instances work in parallel, maximizes hardware utilization on expensive GPU clusters. The looming data shortage that could slow AI coding model progress Buried in Li&#x27;s technical report is a finding with significant implications for the future of AI development: the training dataset for NousCoder-14B encompasses \"a significant portion of all readily available, verifiable competitive programming problems in a standardized dataset format.\" In other words, for this particular domain, the researchers are approaching the limits of high-quality training data. \"The total number of competitive programming problems on the Internet is roughly the same order of magnitude,\" Li wrote, referring to the 24,000 problems used for training. \"This suggests that within the competitive programming domain, we have approached the limits of high-quality data.\" This observation echoes growing concern across the AI industry about data constraints. While compute continues to scale according to well-understood economic and engineering principles, training data is \"increasingly finite,\" as Li put it. \"It appears that some of the most important research that needs to be done in the future will be in the areas of synthetic data generation and data efficient algorithms and architectures,\" he concluded. The challenge is particularly acute for competitive programming because the domain requires problems with known correct solutions that can be verified automatically. Unlike natural language tasks where human evaluation or proxy metrics suffice, code either works or it doesn&#x27;t — making synthetic data generation considerably more difficult. Li identified one potential avenue: training models not just to solve problems but to generate solvable problems, enabling a form of self-play similar to techniques that proved successful in game-playing AI systems. \"Once synthetic problem generation is solved, self-play becomes a very interesting direction,\" he wrote. A $65 million bet that open-source AI can compete with Big Tech Nous Research has carved out a distinctive position in the AI landscape: a company committed to open-source releases that compete with — and sometimes exceed — proprietary alternatives. The company raised $50 million in April 2025 in a round led by Paradigm, the cryptocurrency-focused venture firm founded by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam. Total funding reached $65 million, according to some reports. The investment reflected growing interest in decentralized approaches to AI training, an area where Nous Research has developed its Psyche platform . Previous releases include Hermes 4 , a family of models that we reported \" outperform ChatGPT without content restrictions ,\" and DeepHermes-3, which the company described as the first \" toggle-on reasoning model \" — allowing users to activate extended thinking capabilities on demand. The company has cultivated a distinctive aesthetic and community, prompting some skepticism about whether style might overshadow substance. \"Ofc i&#x27;m gonna believe an anime pfp company. stop benchmarkmaxxing ffs,\" wrote one critic on X , referring to Nous Research&#x27;s anime-style branding and the industry practice of optimizing for benchmark performance. Others raised technical questions. \" Based on the benchmark, Nemotron is better ,\" noted one commenter, referring to Nvidia&#x27;s family of language models. Another asked whether NousCoder-14B is \"agentic focused or just &#x27;one shot&#x27; coding\" — a distinction that matters for practical software development, where iterating on feedback typically produces better results than single attempts.

      "full_content": "<p>NVIDIA has just released its new streaming English transcription model (Nemotron Speech ASR) built specifically for low latency voice agents and live captioning. The checkpoint <code>nvidia/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b</code> on Hugging Face combines a cache aware FastConformer encoder with an RNNT decoder, and is tuned for both streaming and batch workloads on modern NVIDIA GPUs. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-model-design-architecture-and-input-assumptions\"><strong>Model design, architecture and input assumptions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nemotron Speech ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) is a 600M parameter model based on a cache aware FastConformer encoder with 24 layers and an RNNT decoder. The encoder uses aggressive 8x convolutional downsampling to reduce the number of time steps, which directly lowers compute and memory costs for streaming workloads. The model consumes 16 kHz mono audio and requires at least 80 ms of input audio per chunk. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Runtime latency is controlled through configurable context sizes. The model exposes 4 standard chunk configurations, corresponding to about 80 ms, 160 ms, 560 ms and 1.12 s of audio. These modes are driven by the <code>att_context_size</code> parameter, which sets left and right attention context in multiples of 80 ms frames, and can be changed at inference time without retraining. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cache-aware-streaming-not-buffered-sliding-windows\"><strong>Cache aware streaming, not buffered sliding windows</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional &#8216;streaming ASR&#8217; often uses overlapping windows. Each incoming window reprocesses part of the previous audio to maintain context, which wastes compute and causes latency to drift upward as concurrency increases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nemotron Speech ASR instead keeps a cache of encoder states for all self attention and convolution layers. Each new chunk is processed once, with the model reusing cached activations rather than recomputing overlapping context. <strong>This gives:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Non overlapping frame processing, so work scales linearly with audio length</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Predictable memory growth, because cache size grows with sequence length rather than concurrency related duplication</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stable latency under load, which is critical for turn taking and interruption in voice agents</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-accuracy-vs-latency-wer-under-streaming-constraints\"><strong>Accuracy vs latency: WER under streaming constraints</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nemotron Speech ASR is evaluated on the Hugging Face OpenASR leaderboard datasets, including AMI, Earnings22, Gigaspeech and LibriSpeech. Accuracy is reported as word error rate (WER) for different chunk sizes. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-77228\" height=\"1563\" src=\"https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/blog-banner23-11.png\" style=\"width: 692px; height: auto;\" width=\"2188\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>For an average across these benchmarks, the model achieves:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>About 7.84 percent WER at 0.16 s chunk size</li>\n\n\n\n<li>About 7.22 percent WER at 0.56 s chunk size</li>\n\n\n\n<li>About 7.16 percent WER at 1.12 s chunk size </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This illustrates the latency accuracy tradeoff. Larger chunks give more phonetic context and slightly lower WER, but even the 0.16 s mode keeps WER under 8 percent while remaining usable for real time agents. Developers can choose the operating point at inference time depending on application needs, for example 160 ms for aggressive voice agents, or 560 ms for transcription centric workflows. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-throughput-and-concurrency-on-modern-gpus\"><strong>Throughput and concurrency on modern GPUs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The cache aware design has measurable impact on concurrency. On an NVIDIA H100 GPU, Nemotron Speech ASR supports about 560 concurrent streams at a 320 ms chunk size, roughly 3x the concurrency of a baseline streaming system at the same latency target. RTX A5000 and DGX B200 benchmarks show similar throughput gains, with more than 5x concurrency on A5000 and up to 2x on B200 across typical latency settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equally important, latency remains stable as concurrency increases. In Modal’s tests with 127 concurrent WebSocket clients at 560 ms mode, the system maintained a median end to end delay around 182 ms without drift, which is essential for agents that must stay synchronized with live speech over multi minute sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-training-data-and-ecosystem-integration\"><strong>Training data and ecosystem integration</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nemotron Speech ASR is trained mainly on the English portion of NVIDIA’s Granary dataset along with a large mixture of public speech corpora, for a total of about 285k hours of audio. Datasets include YouTube Commons, YODAS2, Mosel, LibriLight, Fisher, Switchboard, WSJ, VCTK, VoxPopuli and multiple Mozilla Common Voice releases. Labels combine human and ASR generated transcripts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-key-takeaways\"><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Nemotron Speech ASR is a 0.6B parameter English streaming model that uses a cache aware FastConformer encoder with an RNNT decoder and operates on 16 kHz mono audio with at least 80 ms input chunks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The model exposes 4 inference time chunk configurations, about 80 ms, 160 ms, 560 ms and 1.12 s, which let engineers trade latency for accuracy without retraining while keeping WER around 7.2 percent to 7.8 percent on standard ASR benchmarks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cache aware streaming removes overlapping window recomputation so each audio frame is encoded once, which yields about 3 times higher concurrent streams on H100, more than 5 times on RTX A5000 and up to 2 times on DGX B200 compared to a buffered streaming baseline at similar latency.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In an end to end voice agent with Nemotron Speech ASR, Nemotron 3 Nano 30B and Magpie TTS, measured median time to final transcription is about 24 ms and server side voice to voice latency on RTX 5090 is around 500 ms, which makes ASR a small fraction of the total latency budget.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nemotron Speech ASR is released as a NeMo checkpoint under the NVIDIA Permissive Open Model License with open weights and training details, so teams can self host, fine tune and profile the full stack for low latency voice agents and speech applications.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the <strong><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MODEL WEIGHTS here</a></strong>. Also, feel free to follow us on <strong><a href=\"https://x.com/intent/follow?screen_name=marktechpost\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></strong> and don’t forget to join our <strong><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearningnews/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">100k+ ML SubReddit</a></strong> and Subscribe to <strong><a href=\"https://www.aidevsignals.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">our Newsletter</a></strong>.
