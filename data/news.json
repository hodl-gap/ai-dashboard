      "full_content": "<p>Nigeria’s push to position itself as a serious player in the global digital economy is increasingly converging on a single piece of infrastructure: data centres. As artificial intelligence workloads begin to reshape computing demand worldwide, the question is no longer whether Nigeria will build more data centres, but whether it is ready to host facilities capable of supporting AI at scale. Based on current projects, investment timelines, and technical constraints, the data suggests that Nigeria is closer than ever to commissioning its first true AI-focused data centre by 2026—but with important caveats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nigeria already hosts 17 operational data centres, with at least nine more either under construction or at advanced planning stages. One of the next additions is Equinix’s LG3 carrier-neutral facility on Victoria Island, Lagos, a 1-megawatt site scheduled for <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/11/11/equinix-data-centre/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">commissioning in the first quarter of 2026</a>. This rapid build-out places Nigeria among Africa’s fastest-growing data infrastructure markets, driven by rising demand from cloud service providers, financial institutions, telecom operators, and digital-native businesses. While installed capacity <a href=\"https://verraki.africa/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Opportunities-in-the-Rising-Data-Centre-Economy-in-Africa-04.12.25.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">currently stands between 65 and 86 megawatts</a>, industry projections suggest it could climb beyond 400 megawatts within the next three to five years as new facilities are completed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That build-out is anchored in a compelling investment story. Nigeria’s data centre market was valued at about $1.4 billion in 2025 and is projected to grow to $2.7 billion by 2035, representing an estimated compound annual growth rate of 7%, <a href=\"https://verraki.africa/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Opportunities-in-the-Rising-Data-Centre-Economy-in-Africa-04.12.25.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to a Verraki report published</a> in December 2025. Rising enterprise digitalisation, increased cloud adoption, the growth of fintech and e-commerce, and the emergence of AI-driven workloads are all fuelling demand. Consequently, local and international investors view Nigeria not only as a large domestic market but also as a strategic entry point into the wider West African digital economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why AI changes the equation</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional enterprise data centres are designed around relatively modest rack densities, <a href=\"https://www.datacenters.com/news/kw-per-rack-explained-optimize-your-data-center#:~:text=What%20is%20kW%20per%20Rack,:%2010%E2%80%9350%20kW/rack\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">typically between 10 and 15 kilowatts per rack</a>. AI workloads, particularly those involving large language models and GPU clusters, demand far more power, cooling, and network performance. At scale, AI-focused racks can require anywhere from <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/ai-power-expanding-data-center-capacity-to-meet-growing-demand\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">60 to 100 kilowatts per rack</a>, often relying on liquid cooling and highly resilient power infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Krish Ranganath, Regional Executive for West Africa at Africa Data Centres, a Cassava Technologies subsidiary with an operational 1.2MW capacity out of a 10 MW facility in project level and designed to scale up to 20.65 MW in Eko Atlantic City, Lagos, to meet growing AI and cloud demand, explains the difference clearly: “An AI data centre is fundamentally about high rack density.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While supporting technologies such as cooling, networking, and power redundancy can be engineered over time, density is the defining constraint. Under current conditions, Ranganath notes that a 25-kilowatt rack can support entry-level AI workloads if the facility is designed to scale. However, truly AI-native deployments require expandability and long-term power certainty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge is that data centres, whether conventional or high-density, take time to build. Typical construction timelines range from 16 to 20 months, even before accounting for power connections, imported equipment, and commissioning. While prefabricated solutions can shorten deployment cycles, they are difficult to deploy at hyperscale and often come with technical limitations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Economic impact strengthens the case</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond digital capability, the economic impact of data centres strengthens the argument for accelerated investment. Modelling by Verraki shows that a $10 million, 1-megawatt Tier III data centre generates approximately $17 million in economic output during the construction phase alone. When operational expenditure and refresh capital expenditure are included, cumulative economic output exceeds $39 million over ten years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employment effects are equally significant. A single 1-megawatt facility supports roughly 700 construction jobs and 20 to 30 operational roles annually, resulting in more than 1,600 cumulative jobs over a decade. These roles span engineering, power management, cooling, cybersecurity, and facilities operations, aligning closely with Nigeria’s push for skilled technical employment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At an industry level, costs remain high. Modern Tier III data centres typically require between $10 million and $15 million per megawatt to build. <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/04/01/why-data-centre-investors-are-flocking-to-lagos-coastline/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Open Access Data Centres’ 24-megawatt Lagos facility</a>, for instance, carries a <a href=\"https://developingtelecoms.com/telecom-technology/data-centres-networks/18230-oadc-to-invest-us-240m-to-expand-lagos-data-centre-to-24mw-by-2027.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported cost of $240 million</a>. Yet the multiplier effects—job creation, tax revenue, and demand for energy and ICT services—continue to attract capital.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Big players are already committing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Global and regional operators are no longer treating Nigeria as a speculative market. Open Access Data Centres announced a $500 million investment across Africa in 2021 and has since established operational facilities in Lagos and South Africa. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-23/us-data-center-operator-equinix-plans-390-million-africa-build\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">In 2024, Equinix committed $390 million to the continent over five years</a>. <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/07/01/mtn-nigeria-completes-first-phase-of-235-million-data-centre/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MTN Nigeria is building a 1,500-rack Tier IV facility</a>, while Airtel Africa’s Nxtra project in Nigeria is expected <a href=\"https://airtel.africa/airtel-africa-launches-nxtra-airtel-accelerate-africas-digital-transformation#:~:text=Airtel%20Africa%20launches%20Nxtra%20by,Africa's%20digital%20transformation%20%7C%20Airtel%20Africa\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to go live by the first quarter of 2026</a> as part of a broader hyperscale strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Airtel’s Lagos facility is notable because it is being designed specifically for AI compute rather than traditional cloud storage. The project represents a $120 million investment, with early shipments of high-performance GPUs already delivered in late 2025. This marks a shift from “AI-ready” marketing toward explicit AI workload support.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Kasi Cloud and the strongest AI signal yet</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The strongest signal that Nigeria could host its first true AI data centre by 2026 is <a href=\"https://www.thisdaylive.com/2025/12/11/agogbua-we-will-deliver-world-class-data-centre-facilities/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kasi Cloud’s flagship campus in Lekki</a>, Lagos. As of January 2026, the LOS1 facility is in its final stages of completion, <a href=\"https://www.kasicloud.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">with some parts of the facility already in use</a>, and is widely regarded as one of the most ambitious hyperscale developments on the continent. Backed by a $250 million investment and supported by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority, the project was conceived to handle the extreme power densities and cooling demands associated with AI and advanced cloud workloads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Built on a 4.2-hectare site with roughly 172,000 square feet of white space, the campus is designed to scale significantly. At full build-out, it can host between 3,000 and 4,000 racks across multiple data halls. Power infrastructure is a defining feature: the site is anchored by the largest dedicated data centre substation in Africa, with a total capacity of up to 100 megawatts. The first phase is designed to deliver between 32 and 44.4 megawatts of critical IT load, supporting rack densities that range from conventional 8 kilowatts to peaks of 100 kilowatts per rack, a threshold typically associated with liquid-cooled AI systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Location and resilience further strengthen the case. The campus is situated along the Lekki corridor, adjacent to several submarine cable landing stations, providing low-latency connectivity to global networks. It is engineered to Tier IV reliability standards and is targeting up to 95% renewable and carbon-free energy usage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Alex Tsado, co-founder and COO of Ahura AI and a founding member of the Alliance for Africa’s Intelligence (Alliance4AI), the facility has already opened its doors. He said Kasi Cloud is optimised for AI GPUs and is working in partnership with UduTech, a GPU cloud platform that accelerates AI innovation across Africa, founded by Tsado, to provide GPU cloud services tailored to regional AI demand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“UduTech plans to partner with them and MSI to link the GPUs to its cloud platform,” Tsado told TechCabal. “When the GPUs aren’t being used for gaming, others can rent them to run AI workloads at low cost, generating revenue for the GPU owners as well. Essentially, it’s a model where distributed GPUs earn money for everyone involved.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>GPUs, power, and the remaining constraints</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While infrastructure readiness is improving, constraints remain. Almost all specialised equipment, from GPUs to cooling systems, is imported, exposing projects to currency volatility and supply chain delays, according to Ranganath. High-quality, reliable power remains the single most critical factor, alongside dense network connectivity capable of handling large data flows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also transitional models emerging. <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/11/04/rack-centre-goes-hybrid-with-gas-and-solar/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rack Centre’s 12-megawatt LGS2 facility</a>, launched in 2025, <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/11/04/rack-centre-goes-hybrid-with-gas-and-solar/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">is marketed as AI-ready</a>, while partnerships such as NVIDIA and Cassava Technologies’ $700 million pan-African initiative aim <a href=\"https://www.cassavatechnologies.com/cassava-to-upgrade-its-data-centres-with-nvidia-supercomputers-to-drive-africas-ai-future/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to deploy thousands of GPUs</a> across Africa Data Centres facilities, including in Nigeria. These deployments are designed to close the computing gap for startups that previously depended on expensive foreign cloud credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are probably other AI-ready data centres or GPU system operators that I’m not aware of, but I believe Rack Centre is AI-ready,&#8221; Tsado said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evidence suggests that Nigeria is unlikely to flip a switch overnight into full hyperscale AI dominance. However, at least one AI-focused facility is likely to go live by late 2026, particularly as projects like Kasi Cloud and Airtel Nxtra move from construction to commissioning. As Ranganath cautions, many projects remain in redesign stages, and timelines are sensitive to power availability and execution risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

Located in Ikoyi, one of Lagos’ key commercial districts, the facility marks a significant step toward building low-latency, resilient digital infrastructure across the country. The Ikoyi Metro EDGE facility is the first regional node in Fringe’s broader Metro EDGE platform, designed to bring high-performance compute and data services closer to users in dense urban centers. Unlike traditional large-scale data centers located far from city cores, edge facilities prioritize proximity, enabling faster data processing and improved reliability for digital services. Powering Nigeria’s Next Phase of Digital Growth Nigeria’s technology ecosystem — spanning fintech, e-commerce, cloud services, artificial intelligence, and digital media — has grown faster than the infrastructure supporting it. By hosting compute capacity closer to businesses and consumers, the Ikoyi Metro EDGE facility aims to reduce latency, improve uptime, and strengthen digital resilience in Africa’s largest economy. Industry analysts note that edge data centers are increasingly critical as applications become more data-intensive and time-sensitive. Services such as real-time payments, AI-driven platforms, video streaming, and enterprise cloud workloads all depend on fast and reliable access to computing resources — a gap Metro EDGE facilities are designed to fill. Strategic Location in Lagos Sited in Ikoyi, the heart of Lagos’ financial and technology corridor, the new facility places critical infrastructure close to banks, startups, multinational firms, and government institutions. This proximity supports faster connectivity and helps organizations meet data sovereignty and compliance requirements by keeping sensitive data hosted locally. According to Fringe, the Ikoyi Metro EDGE launch reflects a broader shift in how digital infrastructure is deployed across Africa — moving from centralized models to distributed, city-based nodes that better match urban demand. Building a Pan-African EDGE Network The Ikoyi launch is positioned as the starting point for a wider rollout of Metro EDGE facilities across major African cities. Fringe has signaled plans to expand the platform to support regional cloud providers, global technology firms, and local enterprises seeking scalable, carrier-neutral infrastructure. As governments and businesses across the continent accelerate digital transformation, investments in edge infrastructure are expected to play a key role in enabling smart cities, AI adoption, and next-generation digital services. A Signal of Confidence in Nigeria Beyond its technical impact, the Ikoyi Metro EDGE launch sends a strong signal of confidence in Nigeria’s long-term digital potential. With a young, tech-savvy population and one of the world’s fastest-growing digital markets, Nigeria is increasingly seen as a cornerstone of Africa’s digital future. The addition of modern, locally hosted infrastructure strengthens that position — helping ensure that innovation, data, and value creation remain closer to home.

Now, that expectation has become reality. The round closed above target shows how quickly Elon Musk’s venture has moved from challenger to prominent player in the global AI race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>xAI initially set out to secure $15 billion. Instead, investor demand pushed the round to $20 billion, a scale that could lift the company’s valuation beyond $230 billion, according to people familiar with the deal. For a company founded in 2023, that pace is extraordinary, even by Silicon Valley standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before this $20 billion round, xAI had already tested investor appetite. Earlier funding valued the company at <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/elon-musk-s-ai-rockets-to-200b-valuation-with-10b-funding-launches-grok-4-fast/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">around $200 billion after a $10 billion raise</a>, coinciding with the launch of Grok 4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The funding will be used to expand what xAI calls its decisive compute advantage. In practice, that means doubling down on large-scale data centres and the infrastructure needed to train increasingly complex models.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-capital-keeps-flooding-the-same-few-players\"><strong>Why capital keeps flooding the same few players</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The deal lands amid a record concentration of venture funding. PitchBook data shows that nearly two-thirds of venture capital deployed in the <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/openai-anthropic-xai-ai-funding-trends-2025/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">first nine months of 2025 went into AI</a>. But the real story is where that money ends up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foundational model companies xAI alongside <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/openai-to-raise-massive-funding-at-750b-valuation-with-big-infrastructure-plans/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/anthropic-raises-13b-series-f/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Anthropic</a> have absorbed the bulk of investor attention. Together, they now account for close to $1 trillion in private market value, turning AI into a scale-driven contest where only a handful of firms can realistically compete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>xAI’s backers in the latest round include <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/oura-raises-hits-11b-valuation-becomes-europes-first-health-tracking-decacorn/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fidelity</a>, the <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/firgun-ventures-250m-quantum-vc-fund-qatar-investment-authority/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Qatar Investment Authority</a>, <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/commercial-trucking-insurer-nirvana-insurance-hits-1-5b-valuation-with-100m-funding/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Valor Equity Partners</a>, and Nvidia. Total funding now exceeds $42 billion, showing that investors see xAI less as a startup and more as emerging infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"speed-and-scale-are-the-big-bets\"><strong>Speed and scale are the big bets</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Elon Musk’s return to AI has been anything but quiet. After co-founding OpenAI and later splitting amid disagreements with Sam Altman, Musk entered a market already dominated by mature products from OpenAI and Google. His response was speed and scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>xAI built major data centres in Memphis and launched Grok, a chatbot deliberately positioned as more provocative than its rivals. That edge has drawn attention and backlash over offensive outputs and controversial behaviour. A new model, Grok 5, is due early this year, with Musk publicly assigning it a 10% chance of reaching artificial general intelligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside the technology push, Musk has escalated legal battles against OpenAI and Apple, accusing them of anticompetitive conduct, cases that remain unresolved. For xAI, the message is consistent and it is growth, conflict, and capital are all part of the same strategy.</p>",

San Francisco-based LMArena flipped that logic early. Instead of synthetic tests or narrowly defined scores, it lets everyday users judge models on real prompts, real tasks, and real expectations. A user types a question, two anonymous models respond, and a single choice determines which one performed better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, LMArena has raised $150 million in a funding round, valuing it at $1.7 billion. This is nearly triple its valuation after its May 2025 seed round. The round was led by <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/factorial-capital-25m-fund-ii-technical-ai-founders-citadel-model/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Felicis</a> and UC Investments, with participation from <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/andreessen-horowitz-targets-10b-fund-to-fuel-ai-and-defence-tech-startups/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Andreessen Horowitz</a>, The House Fund, LDVP, <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/reevo-raises-80m-to-replace-fragmented-sales-tools-with-one-connected-platform/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kleiner</a><a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/reevo-raises-80m-to-replace-fragmented-sales-tools-with-one-connected-platform/\"> Perkins</a>, <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/lightspeed-invests-in-london-based-gen-ai-unicorn-stability-ais-80m-round/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lightspeed</a><a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/lightspeed-invests-in-london-based-gen-ai-unicorn-stability-ais-80m-round/\"> Venture Partners</a>, and Laude Ventures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The capital will support platform operations, technical hiring, and deeper research. More importantly, it reinforces LMArena’s core bet: in an industry crowded with claims of intelligence, progress is best measured by how models perform in the hands of people who actually use them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-leaderboard-rankings-mattered\"><strong>Why leaderboard rankings mattered</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the number of large language models exploded, LMArena’s rankings became a proxy for credibility. A rise or fall on the leaderboard could shape developer adoption, media narratives, and enterprise interest. Model makers began watching the results closely, sometimes obsessively. The influence also brought scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When LMArena partnered with select companies,&nbsp; including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, to make flagship models available for evaluation, critics questioned whether access created bias. In April, a group of competitors published a paper alleging that the setup allowed certain players to game the benchmarks. LMArena strongly denied the claims, but the episode highlighted how consequential its platform had become.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"turning-community-judgment-into-a-business\"><strong>Turning community judgment into a business</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What started as an open research experiment at UC Berkeley, led by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ml-angelopoulos\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Anastasios Angelopoulos</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/wei-lin-chiang-51b025b2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Wei-Lin Chiang</a>, evolved into a massive public signal of model quality. Today, more than five million monthly users across 150 countries generate around 60 million head-to-head comparisons each month. Those judgments power LMArena’s leaderboards, which rank models across text, web development, vision, text-to-image, and other practical tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September, LMArena took a decisive step by launching AI Evaluations, a commercial service that allows enterprises, developers, and model labs to commission evaluations using its community-driven framework. Within four months, the service reached an annualised consumption rate of $30 million, showing how much the market values independent, human-in-the-loop assessment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We cannot deploy AI responsibly without knowing how it delivers value to humans,&#8221; said Anastasios Angelopoulos, co-founder and CEO of LMArena. &#8220;To measure the real utility of AI, we need to put it in the hands of real users. LMArena does exactly this, leveraging feedback from tens of millions of consumers and professionals to set the North Star of the AI industry. Our evaluations use a transparent, open-source methodology to make these insights public for everyone. This funding accelerates the scientific work and community insights that make live evaluation from real users the gold standard for assessing AI in practice.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Without a trustworthy way to measure performance, AI can&#8217;t be safely scaled,&#8221; said Jagdeep Singh Bachher, the University of California&#8217;s chief investment officer. &#8220;LMArena delivers clarity and confidence for researchers, developers and businesses. As AI adoption accelerates, LMArena&#8217;s tools are becoming critical infrastructure.&#8221;</p>",

TechCrunch has confirmed the raise and valuation, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Claude maker last raised a $13 billion Series F round at a $183 billion valuation three months ago, so this raise nearly doubles the AI firm’s value. In March, Anthropic secured $3.5 billion at a $61.5 billion valuation. Coatue Management and GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, will lead the new round, per the WSJ, which cited sources familiar with the deal. Anthropic is expected to close its latest financing in the coming weeks, and the total deal amount could change. This round would be separate from the $15 billion Nvidia and Microsoft recently committed to invest in Anthropic, a “circular” deal that would see Anthropic buying $30 billion of compute capacity from Microsoft Azure running on Nvidia’s chips. The fresh capital comes as Anthropic continues to win over developer hearts with Claude Code , its tool designed to automate coding, powered by Claude Opus 4.5. It also comes as Anthropic prepares for a potential IPO this year alongside its main rival OpenAI . OpenAI is also in talks to raise as much as $100 billion at a valuation of up to $830 billion . Anthropic declined to comment. This article was updated to reflect that TechCrunch separately confirmed the round.

Designed for fast-paced and crowded surgical settings, the system is intended to help anesthesiologists stay focused on patients while reducing cognitive load, alarm fatigue, and the risk of <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-features/how-an-ai-tool-is-quietly-fixing-prescription-errors/\">human error</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second concept targets neonatal care through intelligent, live monitoring powered by agentic edge AI. The system is designed to detect events such as an infant crying or resting, the presence of unwanted objects in the crib, or changes in sleeping position.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All image processing is performed locally on the device using models built with NXP’s eIQ AI Toolkit, ensuring that no images leave the device and supporting security and privacy requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both concepts are built on NXP application processors with integrated neural processing units (NPUs), alongside a dedicated standalone NPU, and are guided by GE HealthCare’s Responsible AI principles, including safety, security, privacy, transparency, and fairness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“At GE HealthCare, we build AI that keeps clinicians at the center, assisting clinical judgment and freeing up time for patient care,” Jeff Caron, chief digital and technology officer, Patient Care Solutions, GE HealthCare, said. He added that working with NXP enables exploration of secure <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/google-introduces-private-ai-compute-for-on-device-gemini-capabilities/\">on-device AI</a> to complement cloud-based solutions in acute care environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charles Dachs, executive VP and GM, Secure Connected Edge at NXP, said the collaboration brings together clinical trust and edge AI expertise to deliver practical, secure solutions. “Together, we aim to enable more personalised care, from continuous monitoring in the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) and hands-free interaction with anaesthesia equipment to exploratory research concepts such as AI-driven risk prediction, automated triage, and personalised treatment recommendations,” he said.The companies said the concepts demonstrate how <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com/it-services/enabling-edge-ai-through-future-ready-software-development-kit/\">edge AI</a> can play a growing role in transforming acute care by delivering timely insights, strengthening data privacy, and supporting clinicians in high-stakes medical settings.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/nxp-ge-healthcare-partner-to-advance-edge-ai-for-acute-care-at-ces-2026/\">NXP, GE HealthCare Partner to Advance Edge AI for Acute Care at CES 2026</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com\">Analytics India Magazine</a>.</p>",

Mobile and Telecoms Top Stories January 7, 2026 Updated: January 7, 2026 Introducing Lenovo and Motorola Qira, a Personal Ambient Intelligence Designed to Work Across Devices By Mamsi Nkosi Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp - Advertisement - Lenovo just announced a significant departure from the chatbot model dominating the AI space. Unveiled at the CES 2026, Lenovo introduced a single, built-in cross-device intelligence designed to redefine how people interact with their devices, applications, and digital services. This Personal Ambient Intelligence launches as Lenovo Qira and Motorola Qira on respective devices. “Lenovo Qira is not another assistant; it’s a new way intelligence shows up across your devices,” said Dan Dery , VP of AI Ecosystem in Lenovo&#8217;s Intelligent Devices Group . “Our goal is to make AI feel less like a tool you use and more like an intelligence that works with you, continuously and naturally.” Lenovo Qira represents a shift from app-based AI to ambient system-level intelligence, meaning intelligence that is context-aware and available across devices without requiring users to open, switch to, or actively invoke a separate application. It isn’t something you open or switch to. It’s always present: understanding what you’re doing and supporting you in the moment, with your permission. By sharing experiences with you over time, it learns your intent, anticipates needs, and acts in ways that feel natural and personal. One Intelligence, Across All Your Devices Lenovo Qira is a single intelligence carried consistently across Lenovo and Motorola devices. Embedded at the system level, it moves with you across PCs, tablets, smartphones, wearables, and more, maintaining continuity as you shift screens, tasks, and environments. Built on three core attributes, Lenovo Qira operates as a true cross-device intelligence, unlike traditional chatbots. Presence Lenovo Qira is integrated at the system level with multiple natural entry points and a familiar, consistent experience across devices. It can proactively surface suggestions, respond instantly when invoked, or stay quietly in the background until needed, adapting to how and when each user prefers to engage. It can be invoked naturally by saying “Hey, Qira,” pressing the dedicated key or tapping the persistent pill. Actions Lenovo Qira can act on the user’s behalf using device capabilities and local AI, including offline, to get things done. It orchestrates actions across apps and devices, coordinates agents, and moves work forward without forcing users to manage every step themselves. Perception Lenovo Qira builds a fused knowledge base that combines user-selected interactions, memories, and documents across devices with user privacy and consent at its core. Through cross-device sensing and perception, it develops a living model of the user’s world, understanding context, continuity, and personal patterns over time. Designed Around Real Moments Lenovo Qira introduces a set of core experiences designed around real user needs, helping people stay oriented, expressive, and in flow across their digital lives. Next Move Whenever you need it, Lenovo Qira offers proactive, contextual suggestions based on what you’re doing in the moment, with continuity across devices evolving over time. It surfaces useful next actions to help you move forward without extra steps. Write For Me From emails and documents to messages and notes, Lenovo Qira helps you write directly on your canvas. It understands what you’re working on, adapts to your tone and intent, and helps you turn ideas into crisp writing, without forcing you to start from a blank page or switch apps. Live Interaction Lenovo Qira enables real-time, multimodal interaction while you are sharing your screen or camera. It stays attentive to what you say and what you show, making collaboration with AI feel fluid and conversational. Catch Me Up Step away and come back without losing momentum. Lenovo Qira summarizes what happened while you were away, highlights what matters, and helps you re-enter your work or conversations with clarity and confidence. Pay Attention Lenovo Qira can support meetings and conversations by providing real-time transcriptions and translations when enabled, capturing key points, and creating summaries you can revisit later. When you need to recall decisions or details, they are brought back instantly. For moments that require deeper immersion, focused AI experiences like Creator Zone help users create and edit visuals and photos with fewer distractions and greater creative control. Privacy and Ecosystem Lenovo Qira is built with privacy by design. Its hybrid AI architecture prioritizes on-device processing to keep personal data local, while secure cloud services extend capabilities with strong safeguards and user control. The Lenovo Qira experience is designed to be secure, ethical, and accountable. Lenovo Qira is powered by a growing ecosystem of industry-leading partners, adding specialized intelligence where it matters most while preserving one consistent, familiar experience across devices. Microsoft’s AI stack through Windows Foundry and Microsoft Azure, provides secure and trusted local-to-cloud capabilities that enable seamless coordination across Windows PCs, tablets, and smartphones. In Creator Zone on PCs, Stability AI enables private, unlimited on-device text-to-image creation using the latest Stable Diffusion 3.5 Flash models, with hybrid support for advanced generative workflows. Notion enables Lenovo Qira users to securely search and reason over a user’s Notion workspace, bringing notes, documents, and plans directly into context, powering a truly fused personal knowledge base. Perplexity&#8217;s AI adds the ability for users to dive deeper into a topic with clear, well-sourced answers and guided follow-ups deepen contextual understanding without breaking focus or switching apps. With Expedia Group’s brands, Expedia and Vrbo , Lenovo Qira can surface relevant travel inventory based on a user’s intent, with seamless handoff for booking and servicing, making trip planning faster and easier. Availability This experience will appear as Lenovo Qira on Lenovo devices and Motorola Qira on Motorola devices, delivering one personal AI across products and form factors. Rolling out on select Lenovo devices in Q1 2026, it will expand to supported Motorola smartphones thereafter, with seamless over-the-air upgrades for existing Lenovo AI Now users and broader expansion over time. -Subscribe to our Newsletter- Newsletter: Sign up to receive daily updates from IT News Africa Thank you for Signing Up Please correct the marked field(s) below.

      "full_content": "Michael Nuñez January 7, 2026 Credit: VentureBeat made with Midjourney Nous Research , the open-source artificial intelligence startup backed by crypto venture firm Paradigm , released a new competitive programming model on Monday that it says matches or exceeds several larger proprietary systems — trained in just four days using 48 of Nvidia&#x27;s latest B200 graphics processors . The model, called NousCoder-14B , is another entry in a crowded field of AI coding assistants, but arrives at a particularly charged moment: Claude Code , the agentic programming tool from rival Anthropic, has dominated social media discussion since New Year&#x27;s Day, with developers posting breathless testimonials about its capabilities . The simultaneous developments underscore how quickly AI-assisted software development is evolving — and how fiercely companies large and small are competing to capture what many believe will become a foundational technology for how software gets written. NousCoder-14B achieves a 67.87 percent accuracy rate on LiveCodeBench v6 , a standardized evaluation that tests models on competitive programming problems published between August 2024 and May 2025. That figure represents a 7.08 percentage point improvement over the base model it was trained from, Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen3-14B , according to Nous Research&#x27;s technical report published alongside the release. \"I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour,\" wrote Jaana Dogan , a principal engineer at Google responsible for the Gemini API, in a viral post on X last week that captured the prevailing mood around AI coding tools. Dogan was describing a distributed agent orchestration system her team had spent a year developing — a system Claude Code approximated from a three-paragraph prompt. The juxtaposition is instructive: while Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Code has captured imaginations with demonstrations of end-to-end software development, Nous Research is betting that open-source alternatives trained on verifiable problems can close the gap — and that transparency in how these models are built matters as much as raw capability. How Nous Research built an AI coding model that anyone can replicate What distinguishes the NousCoder-14B release from many competitor announcements is its radical openness. Nous Research published not just the model weights but the complete reinforcement learning environment , benchmark suite, and training harness — built on the company&#x27;s Atropos framework — enabling any researcher with sufficient compute to reproduce or extend the work . \"Open-sourcing the Atropos stack provides the necessary infrastructure for reproducible olympiad-level reasoning research,\" noted one observer on X , summarizing the significance for the academic and open-source communities. The model was trained by Joe Li , a researcher in residence at Nous Research and a former competitive programmer himself. Li&#x27;s technical report reveals an unexpectedly personal dimension: he compared the model&#x27;s improvement trajectory to his own journey on Codeforces, the competitive programming platform where participants earn ratings based on contest performance. Based on rough estimates mapping LiveCodeBench scores to Codeforces ratings, Li calculated that NousCoder-14B&#x27;s improvemen t— from approximately the 1600-1750 rating range to 2100-2200 — mirrors a leap that took him nearly two years of sustained practice between ages 14 and 16. The model accomplished the equivalent in four days. \"Watching that final training run unfold was quite a surreal experience,\" Li wrote in the technical report. But Li was quick to note an important caveat that speaks to broader questions about AI efficiency: he solved roughly 1,000 problems during those two years, while the model required 24,000. Humans, at least for now, remain dramatically more sample-efficient learners. Inside the reinforcement learning system that trains on 24,000 competitive programming problems NousCoder-14B &#x27;s training process offers a window into the increasingly sophisticated techniques researchers use to improve AI reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning. The approach relies on what researchers call \"verifiable rewards\" — a system where the model generates code solutions, those solutions are executed against test cases, and the model receives a simple binary signal: correct or incorrect. This feedback loop, while conceptually straightforward, requires significant infrastructure to execute at scale. Nous Research used Modal , a cloud computing platform, to run sandboxed code execution in parallel. Each of the 24,000 training problems contains hundreds of test cases on average, and the system must verify that generated code produces correct outputs within time and memory constraints — 15 seconds and 4 gigabytes, respectively. The training employed a technique called DAPO (Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization) , which the researchers found performed slightly better than alternatives in their experiments. A key innovation involves \"dynamic sampling\" — discarding training examples where the model either solves all attempts or fails all attempts, since these provide no useful gradient signal for learning. The researchers also adopted \"iterative context extension,\" first training the model with a 32,000-token context window before expanding to 40,000 tokens. During evaluation, extending the context further to approximately 80,000 tokens produced the best results, with accuracy reaching 67.87 percent. Perhaps most significantly, the training pipeline overlaps inference and verification — as soon as the model generates a solution, it begins work on the next problem while the previous solution is being checked. This pipelining, combined with asynchronous training where multiple model instances work in parallel, maximizes hardware utilization on expensive GPU clusters. The looming data shortage that could slow AI coding model progress Buried in Li&#x27;s technical report is a finding with significant implications for the future of AI development: the training dataset for NousCoder-14B encompasses \"a significant portion of all readily available, verifiable competitive programming problems in a standardized dataset format.\" In other words, for this particular domain, the researchers are approaching the limits of high-quality training data. \"The total number of competitive programming problems on the Internet is roughly the same order of magnitude,\" Li wrote, referring to the 24,000 problems used for training. \"This suggests that within the competitive programming domain, we have approached the limits of high-quality data.\" This observation echoes growing concern across the AI industry about data constraints. While compute continues to scale according to well-understood economic and engineering principles, training data is \"increasingly finite,\" as Li put it. \"It appears that some of the most important research that needs to be done in the future will be in the areas of synthetic data generation and data efficient algorithms and architectures,\" he concluded. The challenge is particularly acute for competitive programming because the domain requires problems with known correct solutions that can be verified automatically. Unlike natural language tasks where human evaluation or proxy metrics suffice, code either works or it doesn&#x27;t — making synthetic data generation considerably more difficult. Li identified one potential avenue: training models not just to solve problems but to generate solvable problems, enabling a form of self-play similar to techniques that proved successful in game-playing AI systems. \"Once synthetic problem generation is solved, self-play becomes a very interesting direction,\" he wrote. A $65 million bet that open-source AI can compete with Big Tech Nous Research has carved out a distinctive position in the AI landscape: a company committed to open-source releases that compete with — and sometimes exceed — proprietary alternatives. The company raised $50 million in April 2025 in a round led by Paradigm, the cryptocurrency-focused venture firm founded by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam. Total funding reached $65 million, according to some reports. The investment reflected growing interest in decentralized approaches to AI training, an area where Nous Research has developed its Psyche platform . Previous releases include Hermes 4 , a family of models that we reported \" outperform ChatGPT without content restrictions ,\" and DeepHermes-3, which the company described as the first \" toggle-on reasoning model \" — allowing users to activate extended thinking capabilities on demand. The company has cultivated a distinctive aesthetic and community, prompting some skepticism about whether style might overshadow substance. \"Ofc i&#x27;m gonna believe an anime pfp company. stop benchmarkmaxxing ffs,\" wrote one critic on X , referring to Nous Research&#x27;s anime-style branding and the industry practice of optimizing for benchmark performance. Others raised technical questions. \" Based on the benchmark, Nemotron is better ,\" noted one commenter, referring to Nvidia&#x27;s family of language models. Another asked whether NousCoder-14B is \"agentic focused or just &#x27;one shot&#x27; coding\" — a distinction that matters for practical software development, where iterating on feedback typically produces better results than single attempts. What researchers say must happen next for AI coding tools to keep improving The release includes several directions for future work that hint at where AI coding research may be heading. Multi-turn reinforcement learning tops the list. Currently, the model receives only a final binary reward — pass or fail — after generating a solution. But competitive programming problems typically include public test cases that provide intermediate feedback: compilation errors, incorrect outputs, time limit violations. Training models to incorporate this feedback across multiple attempts could significantly improve performance. Controlling response length also remains a challenge. The researchers found that incorrect solutions tended to be longer than correct ones, and response lengths quickly saturated available context windows during training — a pattern that various algorithmic modifications failed to resolve. Perhaps most ambitiously, Li proposed \"problem generation and self-play\" — training models to both solve and create programming problems. This would address the data scarcity problem directly by enabling models to generate their own training curricula. \"Humans are great at generating interesting and useful problems for other competitive programmers, but it appears that there still exists a significant gap in LLM capabilities in creative problem generation,\" Li wrote. The model is available now on Hugging Face under an Apache 2.0 license. For researchers and developers who want to build on the work, Nous Research has published the complete Atropos training stack alongside it. What took Li two years of adolescent dedication to achieve—climbing from a 1600-level novice to a 2100-rated competitor on Codeforces—an AI replicated in 96 hours. He needed 1,000 problems. The model needed 24,000. But soon enough, these systems may learn to write their own problems, teach themselves, and leave human benchmarks behind entirely. The question is no longer whether machines can learn to code. It&#x27;s whether they&#x27;ll soon be better teachers than we ever were.",

What’s exciting is how quickly financial institutions are now moving from pilots to full-scale adoption,” she added.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform is designed for natural, compliant conversations and strong responses at scale. From August to October last year, Arrowhead achieved a fivefold increase in ARR, it stated, and boasted that every proof-of-concept has moved to a live deployment without losing a single POC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arrowhead cited deploying its voice AI bots to a large financial institution that carried out full health insurance sales calls, achieving 45% higher conversion rates than human agents and replacing manual operations. Additionally, Arrowhead enabled a financial services firm to contact 100% of its customers for insurance renewals, resulting in a 20% increase in renewal rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arrowhead operates in India and Southeast Asia, serving over 50 clients in various banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) applications. The company partners with major institutions like Bank of Baroda Cards, Aditya Birla Capital, and Paytm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next 12–18 months, Arrowhead plans to improve its BFSI conversational models, enhance infrastructure to support tens of thousands of simultaneous calls with sub-500ms speech latency, and develop emotion-aware voice agents, transitioning into an omnichannel customer interaction platform across chat, calls, and messaging, the company said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vardhan Dharnidharka, principal at Stellaris Venture Partners, added in the statement, “Voice AI for the financial sector in India alone represents a $3 billion market, with less than $50 million penetrated so far, highlighting how early we still are in this transition.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/bengaluru-startup-arrowhead-raises-3-mn-to-expand-voice-ai-capabilities/\">Bengaluru Startup Arrowhead Raises $3 Mn to Expand Voice AI Capabilities</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com\">Analytics India Magazine</a>.</p>",
